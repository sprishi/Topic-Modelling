He has just ended the first round of consultation with his fans and well-wishers who were urging him to take the plunge,"" actor's brother Satyanarayana Rao said. | TNN | Updated: May 27, 2017, 05.36 PM IST Highlights Rajinikanth will make his political stand clear by July-end said his brother Satyanarayana Rao Gaikwad. Rajini asked his fans if they wished to see him enter the political arena and it looks like he may not disappoint them. Rajinikanth likely to announce political party in July, says his brother Actor Rajinikanth's entry into politics is all set to be firmed up by July-end, said his brother Satyanarayana Rao Gaikwad who resides in Bengaluru. 2017-05-27T15:07+00:00 Rajinikanth. Related Videos Rajinikanth likely to announce... BENGALURU: Actor Rajinikanth's entry into politics + is all set to be firmed up by July-end, said his brother Satyanarayana Rao Gaikwad who resides in Bengaluru. ""It is the people's wish that Rajinikanth should enter politics. He has just ended the first round of consultation with his fans and well-wishers who were urging him to take the plunge + ,"" said Satyanarayana, insisting the star's political foray was imminent. Satyanarayana's remarks come in the wake of the actor's address to fans recently. While there was no direct indication of his plans + , there were enough innuendos to create a buzz in political circles. The actor said there were good politicians in Tamil Nadu, but the ""system was rotten"". He urged his fans to help clean up the system and be prepared for ""battle"". Rajini met fans from 15 districts in Tamil Nadu from May 15 to 19. The consultation was given a break for the launch of his new film Kaala Karikaalan + , and Satyanarayana Rao said a few more rounds of consultations would be held in June and July before Rajini comes out with a formal announcement. ""He wants to meet as many fans as possible before firming up his plans. With the response being overwhelming, the outcome would be hopefully positive and Tamil Nadu will usher in a new era in politics,"" said Satyanarayana. Read this story in Tamil He said the main aim behind the move to enter politics was Rajini's intent to cleanse corruption in public life.""The government's coffers are plush with money, but it is not reaching the poor while welfare schemes are not benefiting the needy,"" Satyanarayana added. While the BJP seems to have been wooing Rajini and nudging him to join the party, Satyanarayana Rao said his brother prefers to float his own political party and may not join hands with any. The name and the structure of the party were being worked out, Rajini's brother added. BJP leaders say they are still hopeful of taking Rajinikanth into their party fold. ""The theme of Rajini's politics is going to be anti-corruption and other than BJP no party in Tamil Nadu is suitable to his theme,"" said BJP's Tamil Nadu president Tamilisai Sounderarajan. Rajini's political overtures remained dormant after he publicly supported the DMK-TMC (Moopanar) combine against the J Jayalalithaa-led AIADMK in 1996. He seems to be returning with renewed vigour to take direct plunge into active politics. It is seen as an obvious move by the superstar, who sees space for himself in the void left behind by Jayalalithaa. DMK patriarch M Karunanidhi has retired from active politics with his son M K Stalin taking over the reins. Actor-politician Vijayakanth, who heads DMDK, seems to have lost steam. ""His think tank sees the prevailing political situation in Tamil Nadu as ideal for Rajinikanth's entry."" He said Rajini is likely to do a Chiranjeevi (the Telugu superstar) in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections with his ability to get at least 15 % to 20 % of the votes. He could be a significant force in the state assembly elections due in 2021. Read this story in Kannada Analysts see a BJP pattern wherein the national party supported another Telugu superstar Pawan Kalyan, brother of Chiranjeevi, who launched his own political outfit Jana Sena before the 2014 general elections. Pawan Kalyan aligned with the NDA that won the AP assembly election held simultaneously with the Lok Sabha elections. ""The BJP seems to have been toying with the idea of trying its Andhra Pradesh model politics on Tamil Nadu in the next Lok Sabha elections. And Rajinikanth is its obvious choice,"" said political analyst Tarasu Shyam. We'll welcome him: BJP national general secy P Muralidhar Rao, BJP national general secretary in charge of the party affairs in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, said senior leaders from his party were in touch with Rajinikanth. ""Talks are on with him for some time now. There is a lot of positive vibes mutually. While it is up to him to take the decision, we welcome him if he wants to join BJP,"" he said.

In other words, comparative politics is the study of the domestic politics, political institutions, and conflicts of countries. It often involves comparisons among countries and through time within single countries, emphasizing key patterns of similarity and difference. Arend Lijphart argues that comparative politics does not have a substantive focus in itself, but rather a methodological one: it focuses on ""the how but does not specify the what of the analysis."" [1] In other words, comparative politics is not defined by the object of its study, but rather by the method it applies to study political phenomena. Peter Mair and Richard Rose advance a slightly different definition, arguing that comparative politics is defined by a combination of a substantive focus on the study of countries' political systems and a method of identifying and explaining similarities and differences between these countries using common concepts. [2] [3] Rose states that, on his definition: ""The focus is explicitly or implicitly upon more than one country, thus following familiar political science usage in excluding within-nation comparison. Methodologically, comparison is distinguished by its use of concepts that are applicable in more than one country."" [3] When applied to specific fields of study, comparative politics may be referred to by other names, such as for example comparative government (the comparative study of forms of government ) or comparative foreign policy (comparing the foreign policies of different States in order to establish general empirical connections between the characteristics of the State and the characteristics of its foreign policy). Sometimes, especially in the United States, the term ""comparative politics"" is used to refer to ""the politics of foreign countries."" This usage of the term, however, is often considered incorrect. [4] [5] ""Comparative political science"" as a general term for an area of study, as opposed to a methodology of study, can be seen as redundant. The political only shows as political when either an overt or tacit comparison is being made. A study of a single political entity, whether a society, subculture or period, would show the political as simple brute reality without comparison with another society, subculture, or period. The highest award in the discipline of Comparative Politics is the Karl Deutsch award, awarded by the International Political Science Association . So far, it has been given to Juan Linz (2003), Charles Tilly (2006), Giovanni Sartori (2009), and Alfred Stepan (2012). Contents 1 Methodology 1.1 Comparative strategies 2 Some major works in comparative politics 3 See also 4 References 5 External links Methodology [ edit ] The comparative method is – together with the experimental method , the statistical method and the case study approach – one of the four fundamental scientific methods which can be used to test the validity of theoretical propositions, often with the use of empirical data i.e. to establish relationships among two or more empirical variables or concepts while all other variables are held constant. [6] In particular, the comparative method is generally used when neither the experimental nor the statistical method can be employed: on the one hand, experiments can only rarely be conducted in political science; [7] on the other hand the statistical method implies the mathematical manipulation of quantitative data about a large number of cases, while sometimes political research must be conducted by analyzing the behavior of qualitative variables in a small number of cases. [8] Comparative strategies [ edit ] Two major strategies are used in comparative research. [9] Most Similar Systems Design / Mill's Method of Difference : it consists in comparing very similar cases which only differ in the dependent variable , on the assumption that this would make it easier to find those independent variables which explain the presence/absence of the dependent variable. Most Similar Systems Design, or MSSD, is very helpful since it compares similar objects, it keeps many otherwise confusing and irrelevant variables in the research constant. In a basic sense, MSSD starts out with similar variables between subjects and tries to figure out why the outcome is different between the subjects. The main shortcoming that is said about this method is that when comparing countries, since there are such a limited number of them, all potential factors of explanation can never be kept altogether constant. As such, despite many possibilities of variables, there are only a limited number of cases to apply them to. There are two methods of applying MSSD, the first being a stricter application and the second being a more loose application. The stricter application implies that a researcher would choose various countries that have a number of similar variables, also called control variables, and would only different from each other by one single independent variable. The looser application uses the same general concept, but the researched chooses countries that have similar characteristics but those characteristics are not strictly matched to a set of control variables. Because of the complications of so many variables but not enough cases, a second method was devolved to be used in conjunction with MSSD. [10] Most Different Systems Design / Mill's Method of Similarity : it consists in comparing very different cases, all of which however have in common the same dependent variable , so that any other circumstance which is present in all the cases can be regarded as the independent variable . Most Different Systems Design, or MDSD, differs from MSSD with focus and the fact that it does not take a strict variable application. MDSD uses differences between countries instead of similarities between countries as variables because social scientists have found that differences between countries do not explain their possible similarities if they have any. A more basic idea of MDSD is it takes subjects with different variables within them and tries to figure out why the outcomes between them are similar in the end. When using MDSD as a comparative research method, scientists look at changing interactions between systems in countries and then after all data is collected, the results are compared between the different systems. If the results obtained from this research differ between each other, the researcher must move up to the system level and switch to the MSSD method. When using MSSD as a comparative research approach, there is the independent and depend variable that get introduced, specifically the dependent variable being something that is common in all the research subjects and the independent variable which would be the differing characteristic between the research subjects. MSSD is more precise and strict at finding the differing point along with similarities, but MDSD does not have so many variables and only focuses on finding one similarity or difference between a wide selection of systems. [10] Some major works in comparative politics [ edit ] Aristotle In his work The Politics , Aristotle compares different ""constitutions"", by introducing a famous typology based on two criteria: the number of rulers (one, few, many) and the nature of the political regime (good or corrupt). Thus he distinguishes six different kinds of ""constitutions"": monarchy, aristocracy, and polity (good types), versus tyranny, oligarchy and democracy (corrupt types). Gabriel Almond and Sidney Verba In their work, The Civic Culture , Almond and Verba embark on the first major cross-national survey of attitudes to determine the role of political culture in maintaining the stability of democratic regimes. Robert A. Dahl Polyarchy Montesquieu The Spirit of the Laws Barrington Moore In Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy: Lord and Peasant in the Making of the Modern World (1966) Moore compares revolutions in countries like England, Russia and Japan (among others). His thesis is that mass-led revolutions dispossess the landed elite and result in Communism, and that revolutions by the elite result in Fascism. It is thus only revolutions by the bourgeoisie that result in democratic governance. For the outlier case of India, practices of the Mogul Empire, British Imperial rule and the Caste System are cited. James C. Scott The Art of Not Being Governed Alexis de Tocqueville Democracy in America and The Old Regime and the French Revolution Samuel P. Huntington The Third Wave and Political Order in Changing Societies Arend Lijphart Patterns of Democracy (1999), a comprehensive study of democracies around the world. Juan Linz & Alfred Stepan Problems of Democratic Transition and Consolidation: Southern Europe, South America, and Post Communist Europe Seymour Martin Lipset Political Man: The Social Basis of Politics (1960) Pippa Norris Critical citizens (1999) Robert D. Putnam Making Democracy Work (1993), a major work assessing why some democratic governments work and other fail, based on the study of the Italian regional governments. Theda Skocpol In States and Social Revolutions: A Comparative Analysis of France, Russia, and China Theda Skocpol compares the major revolutions of France, Russia and China: three basically similar events which took place in three very different contexts. Skopcol's purpose is to find possible similarities which might help explain the phenomenon of political revolution. From this point of view, this work represents a good example of a research conducted according to the Most Different Systems Design.

English is a flexible language, and it is not uncommon for a word to have multiple related meanings that run the connotative gamut from good to bad. Some of these have been around for a surprisingly long time. The negative sense of politics , as seen in the phrase play politics , for example, has been in use since at least 1853, when abolitionist Wendell Phillips declared: “We do not play politics ; anti-slavery is no half-jest with us.” Origin and Etymology of politics Greek politika , from neuter plural of politikos political First Known Use: circa 1529 Other Government and Politics Terms agent provocateur , agitprop , autarky , cabal , egalitarianism , federalism , hegemony , plenipotentiary , popular sovereignty , socialism Phrases Related to POLITICS Related Phrases party politics enter politics go into politics office politics play politics sexual politics POLITICS Defined for English Language Learners politics play noun, plural in form but singular or plural in construction pol·i·tics \?pä-l?-?tiks\ Definition of politics for English Language Learners : activities that relate to influencing the actions and policies of a government or getting and keeping power in a government : the work or job of people (such as elected officials) who are part of a government : the opinions that someone has about what should be done by governments : a person's political thoughts and opinions POLITICS Defined for Kids politics play noun plural pol·i·tics \?pä-l?-?tiks\ Definition of politics for Students 1 : the activities, actions, and policies that are used to gain and hold power in a government or to influence a government 2 : a person's opinions about the management of government Hint: Politics can be used as a singular or a plural in writing and speaking.

For the journal Governance, see Governance (journal) . For information on the administrative structure of Wikipedia, see Wikipedia:Administration . ""Governing"" redirects here. For the magazine, see Governing (magazine) . This article needs attention from an expert in Philosophy or Business . Please add a reason or a talk parameter to this template to explain the issue with the article. WikiProject Philosophy or WikiProject Business may be able to help recruit an expert.

[1] It relates to ""the processes of interaction and decision-making among the actors involved in a collective problem that lead to the creation, reinforcement, or reproduction of social norms and institutions."" [2] A variety of entities (known generically as governing bodies ) can govern. The most formal is a government , a body whose sole responsibility and authority is to make binding decisions in a given geopolitical system (such as a state ) by establishing laws . Other types of governing include an organization (such as a corporation recognized as a legal entity by a government), a socio-political group (chiefdom, tribe, family, religious denomination, etc.), or another, informal group of people. In business and outsourcing relationships, governance frameworks are built into relational contracts that foster long-term collaboration and innovation. Poor governance can lead to contract failure. [3] Governance is the way the rules, norms and actions are structured, sustained, regulated and held accountable . The degree of formality depends on the internal rules of a given organization and, externally, with its business partners. As such, governance may take many forms, driven by many different motivations and with many different results. For instance, a government may operate as a democracy where citizens vote on who should govern and the public good is the goal, while a non-profit organization may be governed by a small board of directors and pursue more specific aims. In addition, a variety of external actors without decision-making power can influence the process of governing. These include lobbies , political parties , and the media .

Please help to ensure that disputed statements are reliably sourced . (August 2016) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) Like government , the word governance derives, ultimately, from the Greek verb ???????? [ kubernáo ] (meaning to steer , the metaphorical sense first being attested in Plato ). Its occasional use in English to refer to the specific activity of ruling a country can be traced to early modern England, when the phrase ""governance of the realm"" appears in works by William Tyndale [4] and in royal correspondence between James V of Scotland and Henry VIII of England . [5] The first usage in connection with institutional structures (as distinct from individual rule) is in Charles Plummer ’s The Governance of England (an 1885 translation from a 15th-century Latin work by John Fortescue , also known as The Difference between an Absolute and a Limited Monarchy ). This usage of governance to refer to the arrangements of governing became orthodox including in Sidney Low ’s seminal text of the same title in 1904 and among some later British constitutional historians. However, the use of the term governance in its current broader sense, encompassing the activities of a wide range of public and private institutions, acquired general currency only as recently as the 1990s, when it was re-minted by economists and political scientists and disseminated by institutions such as the UN , IMF and World Bank . [6] Different uses [ edit ] Governance is a very general concept that can refer to all manner of entities. Equally, this generality means that governance is often defined more narrowly to refer to a particular 'level' of governance associated with a type of organization (including public governance, global governance, non-profit governance, corporate governance, and project governance), a particular 'field' of governance associated with a type of activity or outcome (including environmental governance, internet governance, and information technology governance), or a particular 'model' of governance, often derived as an empirical or normative theory (including regulatory governance, participatory governance, multilevel governance, metagovernance, and collaborative governance). Governance can be used not only to describe these diverse topics but also to define normative or practical agendas for them. Normative concepts of fair governance or good governance are common among political , public sector , voluntary , and private sector organizations. Governance as process [ edit ] This section does not cite any sources . Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . (December 2013) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) In its most abstract sense, governance is a theoretical concept referring to the actions and processes by which stable practices and organizations arise and persist. These actions and processes may operate in formal and informal organizations of any size; and they may function for any purpose, good or evil, for profit or not. Conceiving of governance in this way, one can apply the concept to states , to corporations , to non-profits , to NGOs , to partnerships and other associations, to business relationships (especially complex outsourcing relationships),to project teams , and to any number of humans engaged in some purposeful activity. Most theories of governance as process arose out of neoclassical economics . These theories build deductive models, based on the assumptions of modern economics, to show how rational actors may come to establish and sustain formal organizations, including firms and states, and informal organizations, such as networks and practices for governing the commons. Many of these theories draw on transaction cost economics. [7] Public governance [ edit ] Main article: Public administration It is useful to note the distinction between the concepts of governance and politics . Politics involves processes by which a group of people (perhaps with divergent opinions or interests) reach collective decisions generally regarded as binding on the group, and enforced as common policy . Governance, on the other hand, conveys the administrative and process-oriented elements of governing rather than its antagonistic ones. [8] Such an argument continues to assume the possibility of the traditional separation between ""politics"" and ""administration"". Contemporary governance practice and theory sometimes questions this distinction, premising that both ""governance"" and ""politics"" involve aspects of power and accountability . In general terms, public governance occurs in three broad ways: Through networks involving public-private partnerships (PPP) or with the collaboration of community organisations; Through the use of market mechanisms whereby market principles of competition serve to allocate resources while operating under government regulation; Through top-down methods that primarily involve governments and the state bureaucracy . Private governance [ edit ] Private governance occurs when non-governmental entities, including private organizations, dispute resolution organizations , or other third party groups, make rules and/or standards which have a binding effect on the ""quality of life and opportunities of the larger public."" Simply put, private—not public—entities are making public policy . For example, insurance companies exert a great societal impact, largely invisible and freely accepted, that is a private form of governance in society; in turn, reinsurers, as private companies, may exert similar private governance over their underlying carriers. [9] The term ""public policy"" should not be exclusively associated with policy that is made by government . Public policy may be created by either the private sector or the public sector. If one wishes to refer only to public policy that is made by government, the best term to use is ""governmental policy,"" which eliminates the ambiguity regarding the agent of the policy making. Global governance [ edit ] Main article: Global governance Global governance is defined as ""the complex of formal and informal institutions, mechanisms, relationships, and processes between and among states, markets, citizens and organizations, both inter- and non-governmental, through which collective interests on the global plane are articulated, right and obligations are established, and differences are mediated"". [10] In contrast to the traditional meaning of ""governance"", some authors like James Rosenau have used the term ""global governance"" to denote the regulation of interdependent relations in the absence of an overarching political authority. [11] The best example of this is the international system or relationships between independent states. The term, however, can apply wherever a group of free equals needs to form a regular relationship. Governance Analytical Framework [ edit ] The Governance Analytical Framework (GAF) is a practical methodology for investigating governance processes, where various stakeholders interact and make decisions regarding collective issues, thus creating or reinforcing social norms and institutions. It is postulated that governance processes can be found in any society, and unlike other approaches, that these can be observed and analysed from a non- normative perspective. It proposes a methodology based on five main analytical units: problems, actors, norms, processes and ""nodal points"". These logically articulated analytical units make up a coherent methodology aimed at being used as a tool for empirical social policy research. [2] [12] [13] Nonprofit governance [ edit ] Nonprofit governance has a dual focus: achieving the organization's social mission and the ensuring the organization is viable. Both responsibilities relate to fiduciary responsibility that a board of trustees (sometimes called directors, or Board, or Management Committee—the terms are interchangeable) has with respect to the exercise of authority over the explicit actions the organization takes. Public trust and accountability is an essential aspect of organizational viability so it achieves the social mission in a way that is respected by those whom the organization serves and the society in which it is located. Corporate governance [ edit ] Main article: Corporate governance Corporate organizations often use the word governance to describe both: The manner in which boards or their like direct a corporation The laws and customs (rules) applying to that direction Corporate governance consists of the set of processes, customs, policies, laws and institutions affecting the way people direct, administer or control a corporation. Corporate governance also includes the relationships among the many players involved (the stakeholders ) and the corporate goals . The principal players include the shareholders , management , and the board of directors . Other stakeholders include employees, suppliers, customers, banks and other lenders, regulators, the environment and the community at large. The first documented use of the word ""corporate governance"" is by Richard Eells (1960, pg. 108) to denote ""the structure and functioning of the corporate polity"". The ""corporate government"" concept itself is older and was already used in finance textbooks at the beginning of the 20th century (Becht, Bolton, Röell 2004). Project governance [ edit ] Main article: Project governance The term governance as used in industry (especially in the information technology (IT) sector) describes the processes that need to exist for a successful project. Eriksson and Westerberg (2011); [14] Li, Arditi, and Wang (2012); [15] Chen and Manley (2014), [16] and Cardenas, Voordijk, and Dewulf (2017) [17] have hypothesized, developed and extensively tested conceptual models in which relevant project governance instruments and factors were identified and related to the performance of projects. Environmental governance [ edit ] Main article: Environmental governance Land governance [ edit ] Land governance is concerned with issues of land ownership and tenure. It consists of the policies, processes and institutions by which decisions about the access to, use of and control over land are made, implemented and enforced; it is also about managing and reconciling competing claims on land. In developing countries, it is relevant as a tool to contribute to equitable and sustainable development, addressing the phenomenon that is known as ‘ land grabbing ’. [18] [19] The operational dimension of land governance is land administration . Security of land tenure is considered to contribute to poverty reduction and food security, since it can enable farmers to fully participate in the economy. Without recognized property rights, it is hard for small entrepreneurs, farmers included, to obtain credit or sell their business [20] - hence the relevance of comprehensive land governance. There is constant feedback between land tenure problems and land governance. For instance, it has been argued that what is frequently called ' land grabbing ', was partly made possible by the Washington Consensus -inspired liberalization of land markets in developing countries. Many land acquisition deals were perceived to have negative consequences, and this in turn led to initiatives to improve land governance in developing countries. [21] The quality of land governance depends on its practical implementation, which is known as land administration : ‘the way in which rules of land tenure are made operational’. And another factor is accountability: the degree to which citizens and stakeholder groups are consulted and can hold to account their authorities. [22] The main international policy initiative to improve land governance is known as the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of National Food Security (VGGT), [23] endorsed by the Committee on World Food Security (CFS). Internet governance [ edit ] Main article: Internet governance Information technology governance [ edit ] Main article: Information technology governance IT governance primarily deals with connections between business focus and IT management. The goal of clear governance is to assure the investment in IT generate business value and mitigate the risks that are associated with IT projects. [24] Regulatory governance [ edit ] Main article: Regulatory governance Regulatory governance reflects the emergence of decentered and mutually adaptive policy regimes which rests on regulation rather than service provision or taxing and spending. [25] The term captures the tendency of policy regimes to deal with complexity with delegated system of rules. It is likely to appear in arenas and nations which are more complex, more global, more contested and more liberally democratic. [26] The term builds upon and extends the terms of the regulatory state on the one hand and governance on the other. While the term regulatory state marginalize non-state actors (NGOs and Business) in the domestic and global level, the term governance marginalizes regulation as a constitutive instrument of governance. The term regulatory governance therefore allows us to understand governance beyond the state and governance via regulation. Participatory governance [ edit ] Participatory governance focuses on deepening democratic engagement through the participation of citizens in the processes of governance with the state. The idea is that citizens should play a more direct roles in public decision-making or at least engage more deeply with political issues. Government officials should also be responsive to this kind of engagement. In practice, participatory governance can supplement the roles of citizens as voters or as watchdogs through more direct forms of involvement. [27] Contract governance [ edit ] (See also contract management .) Emerging thinking about contract governance is focusing on creating a governance structure in which the parties have a vested interest in managing what are often highly complex contractual arrangements in a more collaborative, aligned, flexible, and credible way. [28] In 1979, Nobel laureate Oliver Williamson wrote that the governance structure for a contract is the “framework within which the integrity of a transaction is decided.” Adding further that “because contracts are varied and complex, governance structures vary with the nature of the transaction.” [29] Multilevel governance [ edit ] Main article: Multilevel governance Metagovernance [ edit ] ""Metagovernance"" is widely defined as the ""governing of governing"". [30] It represents the established ethical principles, or 'norms', that shape and steer the entire governing process. It is important to note that there are no clearly defined settings within which metagoverning takes place, or particular persons who are responsible for it. While some [ who? ] believe metagoverning to be the role of the state which is assumed to want to steer actors in a particular direction, it can ""potentially be exercised by any resourceful actor"" [31] who wishes to influence the governing process. Examples of this include the publishing of codes of conduct at the highest level of international government, [32] and media focus on specific issues [33] at the socio-cultural level. Despite their different sources, both seek to establish values in such a way that they become accepted 'norms'. The fact that 'norms' can be established at any level and can then be used to shape the governance process as whole, means metagovernance is part of both the input and the output of the governing system. [34] Collaborative governance [ edit ] See also: Collaborative governance A collaborative governance framework uses a relationship management structure, joint performance and transformation management processes and an exit management plan as controlling mechanisms to encourage the organizations to make ethical, proactive changes for the mutual benefit of all the parties. [3] Security sector governance [ edit ] See also: Security sector governance Security sector governance (SSG) is subpart concept or framework of security governance that focuses specifically on decisions about security and their implementation within the security sector of a single state. SSG applies the principles of good governance to the security sector in question. The objective of security sector reform (SSR) is to achieve good SSG. [35] As a normative concept [ edit ] Fair governance [ edit ] When discussing governance in particular organizations, the quality of governance within the organization is often compared to a standard of good governance . In the case of a business or of a non-profit organization , for example, good governance relates to consistent management, cohesive policies, guidance, processes and decision-rights for a given area of responsibility, and proper oversight and accountability. ""Good governance"" implies that mechanisms function in a way that allows the executives (the ""agents"") to respect the rights and interests of the stakeholders (the ""principals""), in a spirit of democracy . Good governance [ edit ] Main article: Good governance Good governance is an indeterminate term used in international development literature to describe various normative accounts of how public institutions ought to conduct public affairs and manage public resources. These normative accounts are often justified on the grounds that they are thought to be conducive to economic ends, such as the eradication of poverty and successful economic development. Unsurprisingly different organizations have defined governance and good governance differently to promote different normative ends. The World Bank defines governance as: the manner in which power is exercised in the management of a country's economic and social resources for development. [36] The Worldwide Governance Indicators project of the World Bank defines governance as: the traditions and institutions by which authority in a country is exercised. [37] This considers the process by which governments are selected, monitored and replaced; the capacity of the government to effectively formulate and implement sound policies and the respect of citizens and the state of the institutions that govern economic and social interactions among them. An alternate definition sees governance as: the use of institutions, structures of authority and even collaboration to allocate resources and coordinate or control activity in society or the economy . [38] According to the United Nations Development Programme 's Regional Project on Local Governance for Latin America: Governance has been defined as the rules of the political system to solve conflicts between actors and adopt decision (legality). It has also been used to describe the ""proper functioning of institutions and their acceptance by the public"" (legitimacy). And it has been used to invoke the efficacy of government and the achievement of consensus by democratic means (participation). [39] Measurement and assessment [ edit ] Since the early years of the 2000s (decade), [ when? ] efforts have been conducted in the research and international development community to assess and measure the quality of governance of countries all around the world . Measuring governance is inherently a controversial and somewhat political exercise. A distinction is therefore made between external assessments, peer assessments and self-assessments. Examples of external assessments are donor assessments or comparative indices produced by international non-governmental organizations. An example of a peer assessment is the African Peer Review Mechanism . Examples of self-assessments are country-led assessments that can be led by government, civil society, researchers and/or other stakeholders at the national level. One of these efforts to create an internationally comparable measure of governance and an example of an external assessment is the Worldwide Governance Indicators project, developed by members of the World Bank and the World Bank Institute . The project reports aggregate and individual indicators for more than 200 countries for six dimensions of governance: voice and accountability, political stability and lack of violence, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of law , control of corruption. To complement the macro-level cross-country Worldwide Governance Indicators, the World Bank Institute developed the World Bank Governance Surveys , which are country-level governance assessment tools that operate at the micro or sub-national level and use information gathered from a country’s own citizens, business people and public sector workers to diagnose governance vulnerabilities and suggest concrete approaches for fighting corruption. A Worldwide Governance Index (WGI) [40] was developed in 2009 and is open for improvement through public participation. The following domains, in the form of indicators and composite indexes, were selected to achieve the development of the WGI: Peace and Security, Rule of Law, Human Rights and Participation, Sustainable Development, and Human Development. Additionally, in 2009 the Bertelsmann Foundation published the Sustainable Governance Indicators (SGI), which systematically measure the need for reform and the capacity for reform within the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. The project examines to what extent governments can identify, formulate and implement effective reforms that render a society well-equipped to meet future challenges, and ensure their future viability. [41] Section 10 of the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) Modernization Act requires U.S. federal agencies to publish their strategic and performance plans and reports in machine-readable format. The International Budget Partnership (IBP) launched the Open Budget Initiative in 2006 with the release of the first Open Budget Survey (OBS) . The OBS is a comprehensive analysis and survey that evaluates whether central governments give the public access to budget documents and provide opportunities for public participation in the budget process. To measure the overall commitment to transparency, the IBP created Open Budget Index (OBI), which assigns a score to each country based on the results of the survey. While the OBS is released biannually, the IBP recently released a new OBS Tracker , which serves as an online tool for civil society, the media, and other actors to monitor in real time whether governments are releasing eight key budget documents. The Open Budget Index data are used by the Open Government Partnership , development aid agencies, and increasingly investors in the private sector as key indicators of governance, particularly fiscal transparency and management of public funds. [42] Examples of country-led assessments include the Indonesian Democracy Index , monitoring of the Millennium Development Goal 9 on Human Rights and Democratic Governance in Mongolia and the Gross National Happiness Index in Bhutan . Section 10 of the Government Performance and Results Act Modernization Act (GPRAMA) requires U.S. federal agencies to publish their performance plans and reports in machine-readable format, thereby providing the basis for evaluating the quality of their performance of the governance functions entrusted to them, as specified in their strategic objectives and performance indicators. Publishing performance reports openly on the Web in a standard, machine-readable format is good practice for all organizations whose plans and reports should be matters of public record.

But a new clinical approach offers hope. This is a good day, Samantha tells me: 10 on a scale of 10. We’re sitting in a conference room at the San Marcos Treatment Center, just south of Austin, Texas, a space that has witnessed countless difficult conversations between troubled children, their worried parents, and clinical therapists. But today promises unalloyed joy. Samantha’s mother is visiting from Idaho, as she does every six weeks, which means lunch off campus and an excursion to Target. The girl needs supplies: new jeans, yoga pants, nail polish. Listen to the audio version of this article: Download the Audm app for your iPhone to listen to more titles. At 11, Samantha is just over 5 feet tall and has wavy black hair and a steady gaze. She flashes a smile when I ask about her favorite subject (history), and grimaces when I ask about her least favorite (math). She seems poised and cheerful, a normal preteen. But when we steer into uncomfortable territory—the events that led her to this juvenile-treatment facility nearly 2,000 miles from her family—Samantha hesitates and looks down at her hands. “I wanted the whole world to myself,” she says. “So I made a whole entire book about how to hurt people.” Continue Reading handout / Reuters Why Would Jared Kushner Trust Russian Officials So Much? Adam Serwer A Washington Post report suggests the president's son-in-law and adviser sought to give Moscow information he wanted to conceal from America's own intelligence agencies. Why did Jared Kushner seemingly trust Russian officials more than he trusted the U.S. government? Friday evening, The Washington Post broke the story that, according to an intercepted report by the Russian ambassador in Washington to his superiors in Moscow, Kushner sought to use secure communications facilities at the Russian Embassy to correspond directly with Russian officials. The Russian ambassador, Sergei Kislyak, reported that the proposal was made in December, after Trump won the election but before he had taken office. The conversations reportedly involved Michael Flynn, the former Trump national-security adviser who was fired after it was revealed that he lied to administration officials about the content of his conversations with Russian officials. Continue Reading Jonathan Ernst Trump Remains a NATO Skeptic Thomas Wright While he avoided major blunders in the Middle East on his first foreign trip, he may come to regret his failure to affirm U.S. support for the alliance. Presidential trips are hard to assess. George H.W. Bush threw up on the Japanese prime minister; he was sick. Bill Clinton went to China without going to Japan, a big no-no. Someone threw a shoe at George W Bush; he ducked. President Barack Obama failed to meet with human-rights activists in China. His speech was censored on Chinese television. These all passed for big problems. Then again, those were different times. The bar for President Donald Trump on his foreign trips this past week was, by comparison, unusually low. Everyone expected problems. Trump famously knows very little about foreign policy. In his March 17 meeting with Angela Merkel, the chancellor of Germany, he confessed he had never heard of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership or the G-20. She made him a colorful map of the Soviet Union’s sphere of influence, which he apparently liked. So, when Trump embarked on a nine-day trip of five countries, it seemed particularly ambitious. Most new presidents go to Canada or Mexico. Continue Reading Patrick Kovarik / AFP / Getty Images The Dos and Don’ts of Cultural Appropriation Jenni Avins Borrowing from other cultures isn’t just inevitable, it’s potentially positive. Sometime during the early 2000s, big, gold, “door-knocker” hoop earrings started to appeal to me, after I’d admired them on girls at school. It didn’t faze me that most of the girls who wore these earrings at my high school in St. Louis were black, unlike me. And while it certainly may have occurred to me that I—a semi-preppy dresser—couldn’t pull them off, it never occurred to me that I shouldn’t . This was before the term “cultural appropriation” jumped from academia into the realm of Internet outrage and oversensitivity. Self-appointed guardians of culture have proclaimed that Miley Cyrus shouldn’t twerk , white girls shouldn’t wear cornrows , and Selena Gomez should take off that bindi . Personally, I could happily live without ever seeing Cyrus twerk again, but I still find many of these accusations alarming. Continue Reading Mauricio Alejo How to Sleep James Hamblin Should you drink more coffee? Should you take melatonin? Can you train yourself to need less sleep? A physician’s guide to sleep in a stressful age. During residency, I worked hospital shifts that could last 36 hours, without sleep, often without breaks of more than a few minutes. Even writing this now, it sounds to me like I’m bragging or laying claim to some fortitude of character. I can’t think of another type of self-injury that might be similarly lauded, except maybe binge drinking. Technically the shifts were 30 hours, the mandatory limit imposed by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, but we stayed longer because people kept getting sick. Being a doctor is supposed to be about putting other people’s needs before your own. Our job was to power through . The shifts usually felt shorter than they were, because they were so hectic. There was always a new patient in the emergency room who needed to be admitted, or a staff member on the eighth floor (which was full of late-stage terminally ill people) who needed me to fill out a death certificate. Sleep deprivation manifested as bouts of anger and despair mixed in with some euphoria, along with other sensations I’ve not had before or since. I remember once sitting with the family of a patient in critical condition, discussing an advance directive—the terms defining what the patient would want done were his heart to stop, which seemed likely to happen at any minute. Would he want to have chest compressions, electrical shocks, a breathing tube? In the middle of this, I had to look straight down at the chart in my lap, because I was laughing. This was the least funny scenario possible. I was experiencing a physical reaction unrelated to anything I knew to be happening in my mind. There is a type of seizure, called a gelastic seizure, during which the seizing person appears to be laughing—but I don’t think that was it. I think it was plain old delirium. It was mortifying, though no one seemed to notice. Continue Reading AP/The Atlantic What ISIS Really Wants Graeme Wood The Islamic State is no mere collection of psychopaths. It is a religious group with carefully considered beliefs, among them that it is a key agent of the coming apocalypse. Here’s what that means for its strategy—and for how to stop it. What is the Islamic State ? Where did it come from, and what are its intentions? The simplicity of these questions can be deceiving, and few Western leaders seem to know the answers. In December, The New York Times published confidential comments by Major General Michael K. Nagata, the Special Operations commander for the United States in the Middle East, admitting that he had hardly begun figuring out the Islamic State’s appeal. “We have not defeated the idea,” he said. “We do not even understand the idea.” In the past year, President Obama has referred to the Islamic State, variously, as “not Islamic” and as al-Qaeda’s “jayvee team,” statements that reflected confusion about the group, and may have contributed to significant strategic errors.

The subtitle of the new Pirates of the Caribbean movie is “Dead Men Tell No Tales.” The moral of the movie, alas, is that the same cannot be said of dead franchises. The first Pirates film was an unexpected success: wildly overlong and over-plotted yet kept afloat by a wicked, bravura, and utterly original performance by Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow, a swishily swaggering mélange of rum, eyeliner, and impudence. As is customary, the sequel was a pale imitation, and the third installment of the presumed trilogy went a bit trippy and meta. Which would all have been well and good enough. But money makes people do silly things. The half-hearted and wildly unnecessary fourth movie, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides was one such thing. It will surprise no one to learn that the latest installment in the franchise is another. At least On Stranger Tides had the decency to be a standalone movie; with Dead Men Tell No Tales , there is talk of that most pernicious of cinematic gambits, the “soft reboot.” Continue Reading More Popular Stories Executive handout / Reuters Why Would Jared Kushner Trust Russian Officials So Much?

Although it is usually applied to governments, political behavior is also observed in corporate, academic, religious, and other institutions. Political science is the field devoted to studying political behavior and examining the acquisition and application of power , or the ability to impose one's will on another. Its practitioners are known as political scientists. Political scientists look at elections , public opinion, institutional activities (how legislatures act, the relative importance of various sources of political power), the ideologies behind various politicians and interest groups, how politicians achieve and wield their influence, and so on.

Dacko was aware that Bokassa had made plans to take over his government, and countered by forming the gendarmerie headed by Jean Izamo . Bokassa and his men started the coup on New Year's Eve in 1965 by first capturing Izamo and locking him in a cellar at Camp de Roux. They then occupied the capital, Bangui , and overpowered the gendarmerie and other resistance. After midnight, Dacko was arrested and forced to resign from office and then imprisoned at Camp Kassaï. According to official reports, eight people died while resisting the coup. Izamo was tortured to death within a month, but Dacko's life was spared due to foreign intervention. Soon after the coup, Bokassa dissolved the National Assembly , abolished the Constitution and issued a number of decrees, banning begging, female circumcision , and polygamy , among other things. Bokassa initially struggled to obtain international recognition for his regime, but the new government eventually obtained recognition from other African nations. ...Archive/Nominations More... edit Featured picture Credit: United States Air Force Photo taken by a Lockheed U-2 spy plane of the San Cristobal MRBM launch site in Cuba , November 1962, after the Cuban Missile Crisis .

He is widely regarded as one of the great wartime leaders. He served as Prime Minister twice (1940– 45 and 1951 – 55 ). A noted statesman and orator, Churchill was also an officer in the British Army, a historian, a writer, and an artist. During the 1930s, Churchill took the lead in warning about the danger from Hitler and in campaigning for rearmament. On the outbreak of World War II, he was again appointed First Lord of the Admiralty. Following the resignation of Neville Chamberlain on 10 May 1940, Churchill became Prime Minister . His steadfast refusal to consider defeat, surrender or a compromise peace helped inspire British resistance, especially during the difficult early days of the War when Britain stood alone in its active opposition to Hitler. Churchill was particularly noted for his speeches and radio broadcasts, which helped inspire the British people. ...Archive/Nominations More... edit News and Current Events Wikinews on Politics and conflicts May 27 : Former U.S. National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski dies aged 89 May 26 : Taiwan's Constitutional Court legalizes gay marriage, gives legislators two years to amend marriage laws May 17 : U.S. President Trump defends decision to share classified information with Russians May 13 : Changing position, President Trump says FBI Director Comey was fired over Russia investigation, showboating May 11 : Moon Jae-in becomes President of South Korea May 11 : President Trump fires FBI Director James Comey, raising questions about Russia investigation May 10 : Cyberattack, not HBO comedian, caused website wipeout, says FCC May 9 : Emmanuel Macron wins French presidential election race May 2 : Turkey blocks Wikipedia, alleging smear campaign April 29 : U.S. officials disclose Russian think tank plans outlining interference in 2016 U.S. presidential election Other current events : Iran's nuclear program United States debt-ceiling crisis European sovereign-debt crisis edit In this month May 5 , 2005 – A General Election in the United Kingdom sees Tony Blair 's Labour government returned to office with a reduced majority of 66.

More narrowly, it refers to achieving and exercising positions of governance — organized control over a human community, particularly a state . Furthermore, politics is the study or practice of the distribution of power and resources within a given community (this is usually a hierarchically organized population) as well as the interrelationship(s) between communities. A variety of methods are deployed in politics, which include promoting or forcing one's own political views among people, negotiation with other political subjects, making laws , and exercising force , including warfare against adversaries. Politics is exercised on a wide range of social levels, from clans and tribes of traditional societies, through modern local governments , companies and institutions up to sovereign states , to the international level . It is very often said that politics is about power. [1] A political system is a framework which defines acceptable political methods within a given society. History of political thought can be traced back to early antiquity, with seminal works such as Plato 's Republic , Aristotle 's Politics and the works of Confucius . Formal Politics refers to the operation of a constitutional system of government and publicly defined institutions and procedures. [1] Political parties, public policy or discussions about war and foreign affairs would fall under the category of Formal Politics. [1] Many people view formal politics as something outside of themselves, but that can still affect their daily lives. [1] Semi-formal Politics is Politics in government associations such as neighborhood associations, or student governments where student government political party politics is often important. Informal Politics is understood as forming alliances, exercising power and protecting and advancing particular ideas or goals. Generally, this includes anything affecting one's daily life, such as the way an office or household is managed, or how one person or group exercises influence over another. [1] Informal Politics is typically understood as everyday politics, hence the idea that ""politics is everywhere"".

The book title was rendered in Early Modern English in the mid-15th century as ""Polettiques""; [2] it became ""politics"" in Modern English . The singular politic first attested in English 1430 and comes from Middle French politique , in turn from Latin politicus , [3] which is the Latinization of the Greek ????????? ( politikos ), meaning amongst others ""of, for, or relating to citizens"", ""civil"", ""civic"", ""belonging to the state"", [4] in turn from ??????? ( polites ), ""citizen"" [5] and that from ????? ( polis ), ""city"". [6] History of state politics [ edit ] The history of politics is reflected in the origin, development, and economics of the institutions of government . The state [ edit ] Main article: State (polity) The origin of the state is to be found in the development of the art of warfare . Historically speaking, all political communities of the modern type owe their existence to successful warfare. [7] Kings, emperors and other types of monarchs in many countries including China and Japan, were considered divine. Of the institutions that ruled states, that of kingship stood at the forefront until the French Revolution put an end to the "" divine right of kings "". Nevertheless, the monarchy is among the longest-lasting political institutions, dating as early as 2100 BC in Sumeria [8] to the 21st century AD British Monarchy. Kingship becomes an institution through the institution of Hereditary monarchy . The king often, even in absolute monarchies , ruled his kingdom with the aid of an elite group of advisors, a council without which he could not maintain power. As these advisors and others outside the monarchy negotiated for power, constitutional monarchies emerged, which may be considered the germ of constitutional government . [9] [10] Long before the council became a bulwark of democracy, it rendered invaluable aid to the institution of kingship by: [ citation needed ] Preserving the institution of kingship through heredity. Preserving the traditions of the social order. Being able to withstand criticism as an impersonal authority. Being able to manage a greater deal of knowledge and action than a single individual such as the king. The greatest of the king's subordinates, the earls and dukes in England and Scotland, the dukes and counts in the Continent, always sat as a right on the council. A conqueror wages war upon the vanquished for vengeance or for plunder but an established kingdom exacts tribute . One of the functions of the council is to keep the coffers of the king full. Another is the satisfaction of military service and the establishment of lordships by the king to satisfy the task of collecting taxes and soldiers. [11] The state and property [ edit ] Property is the right vested on the individual or a group of people to enjoy the benefits of an object, be it material or intellectual. A right is a power enforced by public trust. Sometimes it happens that the exercise of a right is opposed to public trust. Nevertheless, a right is really an institution brought around by public trust, past, present or future. The growth of knowledge is the key to the history of property as an institution. The more man becomes knowledgeable of an object, be it physical or intellectual, the more it is appropriated. The appearance of the State brought about the final stage in the evolution of property from wildlife to husbandry. In the presence of the State, man can hold landed property. The State began granting lordships and ended up conferring property and with it came inheritance . With landed property came rent and in the exchange of goods, profit, so that in modern times, the ""lord of the land"" of long ago becomes the landlord. If it is, wrongly, assumed that the value of land is always the same, then there is no evolution of property whatsoever. However, the price of land goes up with every increase in something benefiting the landlord. The landlordism of large land owners has been the most rewarded of all political services. In industry, the position of the landlord is less important but in towns which have grown out of an industry, the fortunate landlord has reaped an enormous profit. Towards the latter part of the Middle Ages in Europe, both the State - the State would use the instrument of confiscation for the first time to satisfy a debt - and the Church - the Church succeeded in acquiring immense quantities of land - were allied against the village community to displace the small landlord and they were successful to the extent that today, the village has become the ideal of the individualist , a place in which every man ""does what he wills with his own."" The State has been the most important factor in the evolution of the institution of property be it public or private. [12] The state and the justice system [ edit ] As a primarily military institution, the State is concerned with the allegiance of its subjects, viewing disloyalty and espionage as well as other sorts of conspiracies as detrimental to its national security. Thus arises the law of treason . Criminal acts in general, breaking the peace and treason make up the whole, or at least part of criminal law enforced by the State as distinguished from the law enforced by private individuals or by the state on behalf of private individuals . State justice has taken the place of clan, feudal, merchant and ecclesiastical justice due to its strength, skill and simplicity. One very striking evidence of the superiority of the royal courts over the feudal and popular courts in the matter of official skill is the fact that, until comparatively late in history, the royal courts alone kept written records of their proceedings. The trial by jury was adopted by the Royal Courts, securing its popularity and making it a bulwark of liberty. By the time of the Protestant Reformation , with the separation of Church and State, in the most progressive countries, the State succeeded in dealing with the business of administering justice. [13] Federalism shared power among states and federal government constituting a balance of powers between the Legislative, Executive, and Judicial branches. The state and legislation [ edit ] The making of laws was unknown to primitive societies. That most persistent of all patriarchal societies, the Jewish , retains to a certain extent its tribal law in the Gentile cities of the West. This tribal law is the rudimentary idea of law as it presented itself to people in the patriarchal stage of society; it was custom or observance sanctioned by the approval and practice of ancestors. [ citation needed ] The state of affairs which existed in the 10th century, when every town had its own laws and nations like France, Germany, Spain and other countries had no national law until the end of the 18th century, was brought to an end by three great agencies that helped to create the modern system of law and legislation: [ citation needed ] Records: From the early Middle Ages in Europe there come what are called folk-laws and they appear exactly at the time when the patriarchal was becoming the State. They are due almost universally to one cause: the desire of the king to know the custom of his subjects. These are not legislation in the sense of law-making but statements or declarations of custom. They are drawn from a knowledge of the custom of the people. Unwritten custom changes imperceptibly but not the written. It is always possible to point to the exact text and show what it says. Nevertheless, the written text can change by addition with every new edition. Law Courts: By taking some general rule which seemed to be common to all the communities and ignoring the differences, English common law was modeled after such a practice so that the law became common in all the districts of the kingdom. The reason why in the rest of Europe, there was no common law till centuries later is because the State in those countries did not get hold of the administration of justice when England did. One of the shrewdest moves by which the English judges pushed their plan of making a common law was by limiting the verdict of the jury in every case to questions of fact . At first the jury used to give answers both on law and fact; and being a purely local body, they followed local custom. A famous division came to pass: the province of the judge and the province of the jury. Fictions: Records and Law Courts were valuable in helping the people adapt to law-making but like Fictions, they were slow and imperfect. Though slowly, Fictions work because it is a well-known fact that people will accept a change in the form of a fiction while they would resist it to the end if the fact is out in the open. Finally there is the enactment of laws or legislation. When progress and development is rapid, the faster method of political representation is adopted. This method does not originate in primitive society but in the State's need for money and its use of an assembly to raise the same. From the town assembly, a national assembly and the progress of commerce sprang parliaments all over Europe around the end of the 12th century, but not entirely representative or homogeneous for the nobility and the clergy. The clergy had amassed a fortune in land, about one-fifth of all Christendom but at the time, in the 12th and 13th centuries, the Church was following a policy of isolation; they adopted the rule of celibacy and cut themselves from domestic life; they refused to plead in a secular court; they refused to pay taxes to the State on the grounds that they had already paid it to the Pope . Since the main object of the king in holding a national assembly was to collect money, the Church could not be left out and so they came to Parliament. The Church did not like it but in most cases they had to come. [ citation needed ] The medieval Parliament was complete when it represented all the states in the realm: nobles, clergy, peasants and craftsmen but it was not a popular institution mainly because it meant taxation . Only by the strongest pressure of the Crown were Parliaments maintained during the first century of their existence and the best proof of this assertion lies in the fact that in those countries where the Crown was weak, Parliament ceased to exist. The notion that parliaments were the result of a democratic movement cannot be supported by historical facts. Originally, the representative side of Parliament was solely concerned with money; representation in Parliament was a liability rather than a privilege. It is not uncommon that an institution created for one purpose begins to serve another. People who were asked to contribute with large sums of money began to petition . Pretty soon, sessions in Parliament would turn into bargaining tables, the king granting petitions in exchange for money. However, there were two kinds of petitions, one private and the other public and it was from this last that laws were adopted or legislation originated. The king as head of State could give orders to preserve territorial integrity but not until these royal enactments were combined with public petition that successful legislation ever took place. Even to the present day, this has always been the basis of all successful legislation: public custom is adopted and enforced by the State. [ citation needed ] In the early days of political representation, the majority did not necessarily carry the day and there was very little need for contested elections but by the beginning of the 15th century, a seat in Parliament was something to be cherished. Historically speaking, the dogma of the equality of man is the result of the adoption of the purely practical machinery of the majority, but the adoption of the majority principle is also responsible for another institution of modern times: the party system . The party system is an elaborate piece of machinery that pits at least two political candidates against each other for the vote of an electorate; its advantage being equal representation interesting a large number of people in politics; it provides effective criticism of the government in power and it affords an outlet for the ambition of a large number of wealthy and educated people guaranteeing a consistent policy in a state. [ citation needed ] These three institutions: political representation, majority rule and the party system are the basic components of modern political machinery; they are applicable to both central and local governments and are becoming by their adaptability ends in themselves rather than machinery to achieve some purpose. [14] The state and the executive system [ edit ] The administration is one of the most difficult aspects of government. In the enactment and enforcement of laws, the victory of the State is complete but not so in regards to administration – the reason being that it is easy to see the advantage of the enactment and enforcement of laws but not the administration of domestic, religious and business affairs which should be kept to a minimum by government. [ citation needed ] Originally, the state was a military institution. For many years, it was just a territory ruled by a king who was surrounded by a small elite group of warriors and court officials and it was basically rule by force over a larger mass of people. Slowly, however, the people gained political representation for none can really be said to be a member of the State without the right of having a voice in the direction of policy making. One of the basic functions of the State in regards to administration is maintaining peace and internal order; it has no other excuse for interfering in the lives of its citizens. To maintain law and order the State develops means of communication . Historically, the ""king's highway"" was laid down and maintained for the convenience of the royal armies not as an incentive to commerce . In almost all countries, the State maintains the control of the means of communication and special freedoms such as those delineated in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution are rather limited. The State's original function of maintaining law and order within its borders gave rise to police administration which is a branch of the dispensation of Justice but on its preventive side, police jurisdiction has a special character of its own, which distinguishes it from ordinary judicial work. In the curfew , the State shows early in history the importance of preventing disorder. In early days, next to maintaining law and order, the State was concerned with the raising of revenue . It was then useful to the State to establish a standard of weights and measures so that value could be generally accepted and finally the State acquired a monopoly of coinage . The regulation of labor by the State as one of its functions dates from the 15th century, when the Black Plague killed around half of the European population. [ citation needed ] The invariable policy of the State has always been to break down all intermediate authorities and to deal directly with the individual. This was the policy until Adam Smith 's The Wealth of Nations was published promoting a strong public reaction against State interference. By its own action, the State raised the issue of the poor or the State relief of the indigent . The State, of course, did not create poverty but by destroying the chief agencies which dealt with it such as the village, the church and the guilds , it practically assumed full responsibility for the poor without exercising any power over it. The Great Poor Law Report of 1834 showed that communism was widespread in the rural areas of England. In newly developed countries such as the colonies of the British Empire , the State has refused to take responsibility for the poor and the relief of poverty, although the poor classes lean heavily towards State socialism. [ citation needed ] Taking into account the arguably significant powers of the State, it is only natural that in times of great crisis such as an overwhelming calamity the people should invoke general State aid. [ citation needed ] Political representation has helped to shape State administration. When the voice of the individual can be heard, the danger of arbitrary interference by the State is greatly reduced. To that extent is the increase of State activity popular. There are no hard and fast rules to limit State administration but it is a fallacy to believe that the State is the nation and what the State does is necessarily for the good of the nation. In the first place, even in modern times, the State and the nation are never identical. Even where ""universal suffrage"" prevails, the fact remains that an extension of State administration means an increased interference of some by others, limiting freedom of action. Even if it is admitted that State and nation are one and the same, it is sometimes difficult to admit that State administration is necessarily good. Finally, the modern indiscriminate advocacy of State administration conceals the fallacy that State officials must necessarily prove more effective in their action than private enterprise . Herein lies the basic difference between public and business administration ; the first deals with the public weal while the second deals basically in profit , but both require a great deal of education and ethical conduct to avoid the mishaps inherent in the relationship not only relating to business and labour but also the State and the people administrating its government . [15] Themes [ edit ] Forms of political organization [ edit ] There are many forms of political organization, including states, non-government organizations (NGOs) and international organizations such as the United Nations . States are perhaps the predominant institutional form of political governance, where a state is understood as an institution and a government is understood as the regime in power. According to Aristotle, states are classified into monarchies , aristocracies , timocracies , democracies , oligarchies , and tyrannies . Due to changes across the history of politics, this classification has been abandoned. Generally speaking, no form of government could be considered the absolute best, as it would have to be the perfect form under all circumstances, for all people and in all ways. As an institution created by human nature to govern society , it is vulnerable to abuse by people for their own gain , no matter what form of government a state utilizes, thus suggesting there is no 'best' form of government. All states are varieties of a single organizational form, the sovereign state. All the great powers of the modern world rule on the principle of sovereignty . Sovereign power may be vested on an individual as in an autocratic government or it may be vested on a group as in a constitutional government. Constitutions are written documents that specify and limit the powers of the different branches of government. Although a constitution is a written document, there is also an unwritten constitution. The unwritten constitution is continually being written by the legislative branch of government; this is just one of those cases in which the nature of the circumstances determines the form of government that is most appropriate. England did set the fashion of written constitutions during the Civil War but after the Restoration abandoned them to be taken up later by the American Colonies after their emancipation and then France after the Revolution and the rest of Europe including the European colonies. [ citation needed ] There are many forms of government. One form is a strong central government as in France and China. Another form is local government, such as the ancient divisions in England that are comparatively weaker but less bureaucratic. These two forms helped to shape the practice of federal government , first in Switzerland, then in the United States in 1776, in Canada in 1867 and in Germany in 1871 and in 1901, Australia . Federal states introduced the new principle of agreement or contract . Compared to a federation , a confederation has a more dispersed system of judicial power . [ citation needed ] In the American Civil War , the contention of the Confederate States that a State could secede from the Union was untenable because of the power enjoyed by the Federal government in the executive, legislative and judiciary branches. [ citation needed ] According to professor A. V. Dicey in An Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution , the essential features of a federal constitution are: a) A written supreme constitution in order to prevent disputes between the jurisdictions of the Federal and State authorities; b) A distribution of power between the Federal and State governments and c) A Supreme Court vested with the power to interpret the Constitution and enforce the law of the land remaining independent of both the executive and legislative branches. [16] Global politics [ edit ] Main article: Global politics Global politics include different practices of political globalization in relation to questions of social power: from global patterns of governance to issues of globalizing conflict. The 20th century witnessed the outcome of two world wars and not only the rise and fall of the Third Reich but also the rise and fall of communism . The development of the atomic bomb gave the United States a more rapid end to its conflict in Japan in World War II . Later, the development of the hydrogen bomb became the ultimate weapon of mass destruction. Global politics also concerns the rise of global and international organizations . The United Nations has served as a forum for peace in a world threatened by nuclear war, ""The invention of nuclear and space weapons has made war unacceptable as an instrument for achieving political ends."" [17] Although an all-out final nuclear holocaust is out of the question for man, "" nuclear blackmail "" comes into question not only on the issue of world peace but also on the issue of national sovereignty. [18] On a Sunday in 1962, the world stood still at the brink of nuclear war during the October Cuban Missile Crisis from the implementation of U.S. vs U.S.S.R. nuclear blackmail policy. According to political science professor Paul James , global politics is affected by values : norms of human rights , ideas of human development , and beliefs such as cosmopolitanism about how we should relate to each: Cosmopolitanism can be defined as a global politics that, firstly, projects a sociality of common political engagement among all human beings across the globe, and, secondly, suggests that this sociality should be either ethically or organizationally privileged over other forms of sociality. [19] Political corruption [ edit ] Main article: Political corruption William Pitt the Elder , speaking before the British House of Lords , 9 January 1770, observed: ""Unlimited power is apt to corrupt the minds of those who possess it."" [20] This was echoed more famously by John Dalberg-Acton over a century later: ""Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely."" [21] Political corruption is the use of legislated powers by government officials for illegitimate private gain. Misuse of government power for other purposes, such as repression of political opponents and general police brutality , is not considered political corruption. Neither are illegal acts by private persons or corporations not directly involved with the government. An illegal act by an officeholder constitutes political corruption only if the act is directly related to their official duties and/or power. [22] Forms of corruption vary, but include corruption , extortion , cronyism , nepotism , patronage , graft , and embezzlement . While corruption may facilitate criminal enterprise such as drug trafficking , money laundering , and trafficking , it is not restricted to these activities. [ citation needed ] The activities that constitute illegal corruption differ depending on the country or jurisdiction. For instance, certain political funding practices that are legal in one place may be illegal in another. In some cases, government officials have broad or poorly defined powers, which make it difficult to distinguish between legal and illegal actions. [ citation needed ] Worldwide, bribery alone is estimated to involve over 1 trillion US dollars annually. [23] A state of unrestrained political corruption is known as a kleptocracy , literally meaning ""rule by thieves"". [ citation needed ] Political parties [ edit ] Main article: political party A political party is a political organization that typically seeks to attain and maintain political power within government , usually by participating in electoral campaigns , educational outreach or protest actions. Parties often espouse an expressed ideology or vision bolstered by a written platform with specific goals, forming a coalition among disparate interests. [ citation needed ] Politics as an academic discipline [ edit ] Political science , the study of politics, examines the acquisition and application of power . [24] Political scientist Harold Lasswell defined politics as ""who gets what, when, and how"". [25] Related areas of study include political philosophy , which seeks a rationale for politics and an ethic of public behaviour, political economy , which attempts to develop understandings of the relationships between politics and the economy and the governance of the two, and public administration , which examines the practices of governance. [ citation needed ] The philosopher Charles Blattberg , who has defined politics as ""responding to conflict with dialogue,"" offers an account which distinguishes political philosophies from political ideologies. [26] The first academic chair devoted to politics in the United States was the chair of history and political science at Columbia University , first occupied by Prussian émigré Francis Lieber in 1857. [27] Political values [ edit ] Political views differ on average across nations. A recreation of the Inglehart – Welzel Cultural Map of the World based on the World Values Survey . Main article: Political spectrum Several different political spectrums have been proposed. Left–right politics [ edit ] Political analysts and politicians divide politics into left wing and right wing politics, often also using the idea of center politics as a middle path of policy between the right and left. This classification is comparatively recent (it was not used by Aristotle or Hobbes , for instance), and dates from the French Revolution era, when those members of the National Assembly who supported the republic , the common people and a secular society sat on the left and supporters of the monarchy , aristocratic privilege and the Church sat on the right. [28] The meanings behind the labels have become more complicated over the years. A particularly influential event was the publication of the Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels in 1848. The Manifesto suggested a course of action for a proletarian revolution to overthrow the bourgeois society and abolish private property, in the belief that this would lead to a classless and stateless society. [ citation needed ] [29] The meaning of left-wing and right-wing varies considerably between different countries and at different times, but generally speaking, it can be said that the right wing often values tradition and social stratification while the left wing often values reform and egalitarianism , with the center seeking a balance between the two such as with social democracy or regulated capitalism . [30] According to Norberto Bobbio , one of the major exponents of this distinction, the Left believes in attempting to eradicate social inequality, while the Right regards most social inequality as the result of ineradicable natural inequalities, and sees attempts to enforce social equality as utopian or authoritarian. [31] Some ideologies, notably Christian Democracy , claim to combine left and right wing politics; according to Geoffrey K. Roberts and Patricia Hogwood, ""In terms of ideology, Christian Democracy has incorporated many of the views held by liberals, conservatives and socialists within a wider framework of moral and Christian principles."" [32] Movements which claim or formerly claimed to be above the left-right divide include Fascist Terza Posizione economic politics in Italy, Peronism in Argentina, and National Action Party in Mexico. [33] [ citation needed ] Authoritarian–libertarian politics [ edit ] Authoritarianism and libertarianism refer to the amount of individual freedom each person possesses in that society relative to the state. One author describes authoritarian political systems as those where ""individual rights and goals are subjugated to group goals, expectations and conformities"", [34] while libertarians generally oppose the state and hold the individual as sovereign . In their purest form, libertarians are anarchists , who argue for the total abolition of the state, of political parties and of other political entities , while the purest authoritarians are, theoretically, totalitarians who support state control over all aspects of society . [ citation needed ] [35] For instance, classical liberalism (also known as laissez-faire liberalism , [36] ) is a doctrine stressing individual freedom and limited government . This includes the importance of human rationality, individual property rights , free markets , natural rights , the protection of civil liberties , constitutional limitation of government, and individual freedom from restraint as exemplified in the writings of John Locke , Adam Smith , David Hume , David Ricardo , Voltaire , Montesquieu and others. According to the libertarian Institute for Humane Studies , ""the libertarian, or 'classical liberal,' perspective is that individual well-being, prosperity, and social harmony are fostered by 'as much liberty as possible' and 'as little government as necessary.'"" [37] For anarchist political philosopher L. Susan Brown ""Liberalism and anarchism are two political philosophies that are fundamentally concerned with individual freedom yet differ from one another in very distinct ways. Anarchism shares with liberalism a radical commitment to individual freedom while rejecting liberalism's competitive property relations.""

Drag according to your convenience ET NOW RADIO ET NOW TIMES NOW Why it won't be that easy for Rajinikanth to replicate his celluloid success in politics By G Seetharaman , ET Bureau | Updated: May 28, 2017, 09.37 AM IST Post a Comment A big question that needs to be asked is whether Rajinikanth’s fans, who may be supporters of the DMK or the AIADMK or any other party, will abandon their political affiliation to vote for him in an election. Generate Enquiries for your Business by Listing on Economictimes.com List Your Business Find Service Near You At a condolence meet for former Tamil Nadu chief minister J Jayalalithaa in December, the Tamil actor Rajinikanth said he was one of the main reasons for her party’s defeat in the 1996 assembly election and that really hurt her. In what is till today the most significant episode in Rajinikanth’s tenuous history with electoral politics, he said before the election, “Even God save cannot Tamil Nadu if Jayalalithaa is voted back to power.” He was backing a coalition of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and the newly formed breakaway Congress party, the Tamil Maanila Congress (TMC). Jayalalithaa had become chief minister for the first time in 1991, and five years later, was battling strong antiincumbency sentiments, largely due to a string of corruption allegations against her government, best exemplified by her foster son’s obscenely ostentatious wedding in 1995. Before the 1996 election, Rajinikanth met then-prime minister Narasimha Rao , who asked him to enter politics. But Rajinikanth refused. Role-play Time The writing was on the wall for Jayalalithaa and her party, the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), and Rajinikanth’s statement certainly gave an edge to her opponents. But to say it was crucial to Jayalalithaa’s defeat would be overstating Rajinikanth’s influence on the electorate. His fans and the media have in the past been guilty of just that. Now, with the 66-year-old actor once again giving strong indications about venturing into politics — he has a habit of making cryptic remarks on the subject — there is a tendency among many to start wondering if he can change the political landscape of the state and if he can indeed become chief minister. Why it's a tough road ahead for Rajinikanth in politics During a five-day meeting with his fans in Chennai earlier this month, Rajinikanth said, “My life is in God’s hands. He wants me to be an actor today, but tomorrow if he wants me to be someone else, I’ll accept that too.” He told his fans that he will need them when it’s time for “war”. All the same, he was careful not to offend any political leaders, saying Tamil Nadu has capable politicians like MK Stalin, DMK patriarch M Karunanidhi’s son and the party’s working president, and former Union minister Anbumani Ramadoss of the Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK). ...but he still has a few factors in his favour “But the system is rotten. We need to change that,” he said, not bothering to explain what exactly he meant. Immediately, most leaders across the political spectrum welcomed him to politics, and Amit Shah, president of the Bharatiya Janata Party, which has been struggling for a long time to get a foothold in Tamil Nadu, said the party is open to accepting him if he so wishes. There were even reports that Rajinikanth would meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi this week. (They met in Chennai during the 2014 election campaign but Rajinikanth did not endorse the BJP.) Rajinikanth’s speech comes at a time when there is a lot of uncertainty in Tamil Nadu politics, caused by the death of Jayalalithaa in December 2016 and Karunanidhi’s poor health. Jayalalithaa’s demise led to a split in the AIADMK, after her close aide VK Sasikala set eyes on the chief ministerial post. O Panneerselvam , the then interim CM, broke away from the party with a few MLAs, while the majority remained with Sasikala, who was jailed in a disproportionate assets case. Edappadi K Palaniswami was made chief minister. Now, Sasikala and her nephew, TTV Dhinakaran, who was running the party in her absence, have both been sidelined in the context of the latter’s arrest after he was accused of trying to bribe the Election Commission (EC) to get the party’s “two leaves” symbol. The EC had denied both factions’ claim over the symbol in the by-election to the constituency represented by Jayalalithaa. Dhinakaran was his faction’s contestant in the election which was cancelled by the EC, citing Dhinakaran and his associates’ attempts to bribe voters. Both factions have been going back and forth on talks for an impending merger. The DMK is also entering a new phase of its existence, with Stalin taking control of the party, but he still does not quite measure up to his father in charisma or political acumen. The BJP sees the present scenario as its best chance to make an impact in the state, which in the 2014 general election defied the BJP surge. (The BJP alliance won just two of the 39 seats, with the AIADMK winning the rest). In the 2016 assembly election, the BJP failed to win a single seat. There have also been talks of an alliance between the Panneerselvam camp and the BJP; Panneerselvam recently met Modi in the capital. The Crowd-pleaser The BJP, which lacks popular state leaders, is hoping to ride on the goodwill of someone like Rajinikanth. “If an actor of Rajinikanth’s popularity has an alliance with a party with a credible leadership like the BJP come together, it will be beneficial to both,” says H Raja, national secretary of the BJP. While he has not made it clear if he will join the BJP or float his own outfit, many believe it could be the latter. “His fan base is religion-neutral. His minority fans might be disappointed if he joins the BJP,” says a member of the legislative assembly (MLA) from the Panneerselvam faction of the AIADMK. P Sridhar, who heads a Rajinikanth fan club in Chennai, concurs: “His identity and individuality can be retained only by starting his own party.” Rajinikanth, one of India’s biggest film stars, is often addressed with the prefix ‘Superstar’, which is sometimes used in isolation. Born Shivaji Rao Gaekwad in Karnataka, Rajinikanth made his film debut in 1975 and reached the peak of his stardom in the 1990s with films like Baasha, Muthu and Padaiyappa. Rajinikanth has over the past two decades often played the role of a morally upright and socially conscious underdog, with references to his future in politics While some argue that he is no longer the star he once was, his 2016 release, Kabali, where he played a Dalit gangster fighting for the cause of Tamils in Malaysia, showed he can still draw crowds like no other actor of his generation. Some Tamil nationalist groups have opposed his foray into politics because he is not a Tamilian but Rajinikanth has dismissed that charge saying he lived almost twice as long in Tamil Nadu as he has in Karnataka, and in 2002, he observed a public fast demanding Karnataka release Cauvery water to Tamil Nadu. A big question that needs to be asked is whether Rajinikanth’s fans, who may be supporters of the DMK or the AIADMK or any other party, will abandon their political affiliation to vote for him in an election. Sridhar says even if the DMK’s and AIADMK’s vote banks remain intact, there is a sizeable chunk of neutral voters who might go with Rajinikanth. The two parties polled nearly three quarters of the total votes in the 2016 assembly election. Rajinikanth’s support to an alliance has not always meant victory for it as it did in 1996. In the 1998 general election, he again extended support to the the DMK-TMC combine, but they won just eight seats. Similarly in the 2004 parliamentary election, he said he would support the BJP, but the BJP and its ally, the AIADMK, did not bag a single seat. Vaasanthi, a veteran journalist, says Rajinikanth is tempted to enter politics every now and then because of his fans. “He is a confused man and he never seemed to have any ideology.” She makes light of comparisons between him and MG Ramachandran , a bigger star in his time than Rajinikanth who made the seamless shift to politics. A Congress member who joined the DMK in 1953, he quit the DMK in 1972 over his differences with Karunanidhi and formed the AIADMK. The party coasted to power in 1977 and he remained CM till his death ten years later. “MGR was astonishingly popular. He was a DMK member and propagated its ideology through his films. Women were his biggest supporters but they were never enamoured of Rajinikanth,” says Vaasanthi. Film historian S Theodore Bhaskaran says MGR’s fan base was homogenous thanks to his ideology. “Rajinikanth has a motley collection of fans and nothing binds them politically.” S Thirunavukkarasar, who heads the Congress in Tamil Nadu, believes Rajinikanth cannot depend on just his fans and the support of others is also important. According to Anbumani Ramadoss, a member of Parliament in the Lok Sabha, when MGR and his protege Jayalalithaa, also a wellknown actor, joined politics, voters were ignorant and illiterate. “Now none of the youngsters relate to actors.” He also asks what Rajinikanth’s plans for employment generation and industrial development in the state are and how he intends to tackle distress in agriculture. Ramadoss has been pitching his party as an alternative to the DMK and AIADMK. TKS Elangovan, the DMK’s spokesperson, says the party will decide whether to join hands with him depending on his stand on various issues. He adds that if he goes it alone, given the power struggle in the AIADMK, the DMK’s opposition will be further divided. Jayalalithaa was only the second and last actor to make it big in Tamil Nadu politics. Others like Sivaji Ganesan and R Sarathkumar have tried and failed, and Vijayakanth, who showed promise in the early years of his party, has now been reduced to an afterthought. So it is certainly no walk in the park for Rajinikanth, especially given the rumours that he is not in the best of health and the time he will have to devote his films (his 2.0, a sequel to Endhiran, is in production, and that will be followed by Kaala Karikalan). That said, regardless of his success in the electoral arena, he will certainly bring some pizzazz to Tamil Nadu politics.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Theresa May will not take part in the debate. Photograph: Mark Runnacles/Getty Labour has yet to confirm who it will send to take part in the BBC election debate in Cambridge between 7.30pm and 9pm on Wednesday 31 May. But aides have previously said that leader Jeremy Corbyn will only join debates if the prime minister is also present. The Liberal Democrat leader, Tim Farron, Ukip’s leader Paul Nuttall, Plaid Cymru’s leader Leanne Wood and Green co-leader Caroline Lucas will line up in the seven-way clash, alongside Scottish National party’s deputy leader, Angus Robertson. Rudd was considered to have performed well appearing for the remain side in TV debates in the EU referendum, when she accused pro-Brexit colleague Boris Johnson of “misleading the public” and said: “The only number that Boris is interested in is the one that says Number 10.” The Supreme Leader doesn’t seem quite so invincible now | Andrew Rawnsley Read more The 90-minute broadcast, to be moderated by Mishal Husain , will see each of the panellists make short opening statements followed by questions from the audience and closing remarks. Party representatives drew lots to decide podium positions, which will see Farron placed on the far left and Robertson on the far right, with Wood, Rudd and Labour’s representative in the middle. The order in which statements will be made was also determined by the drawing of lots. Wood will have the first opening statement, while Rudd will have the final closing remarks.

Scheer emerges as new Conservative leader, after Bernier and O'Leary dominated the conversation By Aaron Wherry, CBC News Posted: May 27, 2017 11:18 PM ET Last Updated: May 28, 2017 12:12 AM ET Andrew Scheer celebrates after winning the Conservative leadership during the convention in Toronto on Saturday. Now the party has an amiable, boyish leader who at least offers something of a blank slate, writes CBC's Aaron Wherry.

Follow Aaron on Twitter Related Stories How Andrew Scheer won the Conservative leadership Scheer surprise: Ex-House Speaker wins Conservative leadership race Andrew Scheer vows to support free speech after Conservative leadership win Tory leadership candidates make pitches for conservative values and party unity Anger, betrayal and pride: Views from the Beauce on Maxime Bernier's bid to lead Conservatives Conservatives gather to pick a leader at the scene of Harper's last stand Standing at centre stage, Andrew Scheer looked out at members of the Conservative Party assembled at the Toronto Congress Centre, raised his eyebrows, let out a small breath and smiled. In seeking Stephen Harper's successor, Conservative supporters flirted with a bombastic star of reality television, and very, very nearly went with a dapper neoliberal who proposed a dramatic agenda of free-market economics. But in the end, there was Scheer, a man who is happy to be described as ""Stephen Harper with a smile."" ""It wasn't our policies that cost us the last election,"" Scheer has said . ""When I went door to door in my own riding, when I talked to candidates that ran for us but lost, or MPs that lost their seat, a recurring theme is that they heard time and time again that, 'You know, I like you and I like what you've done, but I just can't vote for you the next time.' ""And that's what I'm trying to address. I'm trying to change the presentation of our party, what it means to be Conservative, the impression that Canadians have when we talk about Conservative policies. I want it to be a positive impression."" Andrew Scheer elected new Conservative leader LIVE BLOG RECAP | Andrew Scheer vows to support free speech after Conservative leadership win So if Conservatives lost in 2015 because Harper didn't smile enough, or if a plurality of Canadian voters will soon want their old Conservative government back, then Scheer's arrival to the leadership of the Conservative Party on Saturday will seem to have been the smart choice. In the moment, the longtime Saskatchewan MP and former House Speaker might seem to simply be the safe choice or the easy choice. Though there is often much to be said for playing it safe. O'Leary bailed, Bernier fell short For a good deal of the race, Kellie Leitch seemed to dominate the conversation. And by the telling of Kevin O'Leary's campaign manager , Scheer might only be leader of the Conservative Party because O'Leary realized he didn't want the job. For that matter, up and until Scheer's name was splashed across the screen at the front of a tightly packed room at the convention centre in suburban Toronto, it seemed as if Maxime Bernier would get O'Leary's vacated throne. Scheer, right, is congratulated by Maxime Bernier after he squeezed by Bernier by one percentage point on the final ballot. (Frank Gunn/Canadian Press) On Friday , Bernier's campaign distributed a one-page biography of his partner, Catherine Letarte — the sort of information that, with all due respect to Letarte, would only be relevant if she were about to become the partner of the leader of the Conservative Party. When it was Bernier's turn to speak on Friday night, his remarks were short and perfunctory. He had apparently used his rehearsal time earlier in the day to practise the speech he would give in victory on Saturday night. Bernier's support on the first ballot was hardly overwhelming: 28.89 per cent of the available ""points"" through which Conservatives choose their leader. But it seemed to position him well. Scheer, of course, was even less overwhelming, 21.52 per cent. And Bernier maintained the lead for every subsequent round, until the last one. What history might say about Scheer's chances Whether Scheer ever becomes prime minister will depend a great deal on Justin Trudeau, on whether the Liberals can make enough of a mess by 2019 (or 2023) that Canadians feel it necessary to replace them. Canadians are historically willing to give their governments a second or third chance. Not since 1935 has a one-term government with a majority been thrown out of office, and in that case, R.B. Bennett's Conservatives might have just been unlucky enough to govern through the Great Depression. Andrew Scheer’s victory speech to Conservatives 17:10 Lisa Raitt was fond of reminding Conservatives that Pierre Trudeau's Liberals nearly lost the federal election in 1972, evidence that members of the Trudeau family were not necessarily invincible. But, of course, the elder Trudeau ended up spending more than 15 years in the Prime Minister's Office, beating poor Bob Stanfield three times. There is also the small matter of Scheer's leadership result. Aside from being the last five prime ministers of this country, what Jean Chrétien, Paul Martin, Harper and Justin Trudeau have in common is that they all became leaders of their parties with decisive, first-ballot victories. Though never prime minister, former NDP leader Jack Layton was a one-ballot winner as well. Opposite to that set of the five most successful party leaders of the last 20 years are Stockwell Day, who needed two ballots to win the Canadian Alliance leadership in 2002, Stéphane Dion, who was the first choice of 17.8 per cent of Liberal delegates in 2006, and Tom Mulcair, who received 30.3 per cent of support on the first ballot at the NDP leadership convention in 2012. The lesson might be that if party supporters aren't sure about who should lead them, they shouldn't expect the general public to be much more enthusiastic. But then Scheer just demonstrated that not everything in politics unfolds in a predictable way. Where will Scheer lead Conservatives? ?And maybe Bernier would have been a risky choice. Bernier's tax proposals were described as ""unworkable"" by Harper's former senior policy adviser, and a sufficient number of Conservatives apparently didn't have the stomach for it, but he was also not quite repudiated. Meanwhile, the two outspoken social conservatives on the ballot — Brad Trost, who said he would never march in a gay pride parade, and Pierre Lemieux — drew a combined first-round share of 15.7 per cent. Leitch, who campaigned on the implicit notion that the social values Canadians hold dear are threatened by the potential immigration of unspecified individuals, received seven per cent of support on the first ballot. In contending with all those varied interests, Scheer at least offers something of a blank slate. Opposite to Bernier's aggressive vision for limited government, Scheer has dabbled in small measures. He would exempt home energy prices from federal sales taxes. He wants to put the flags of foreign countries on gas pumps to remind Canadians that their oil comes from other countries. He wants to use federal funding to defend free speech on university campuses. He, like every other Conservative save Michael Chong, is categorically opposed to the ""Liberal carbon tax,"" which is he calls nothing but a ""cash grab."" Conservatives are, if nothing else, very clear about what they don't like about Justin Trudeau: the selfies, the spending and so forth. And they have fond memories of what they did (or didn't do) while in government. And what Harper left behind seems relatively sturdy. Even if the former Conservative leader didn't smile enough, Canadians elected 99 Conservative MPs in 2015. And the party is still raising more money than the Liberals. Now the Conservatives have an amiable, boyish leader. He even has dimples. Maybe that's enough. Or maybe the other option seemed like too much.
