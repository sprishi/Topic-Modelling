[b] Contemporary science is typically subdivided into the natural sciences , which study the material universe ; the social sciences , which study people and societies; and the formal sciences , which study logic and mathematics . The formal sciences are often excluded as they do not depend on empirical observations. [3] Disciplines which use science, like engineering and medicine , may also be considered to be applied sciences . [4] From classical antiquity through the 19th century, science as a type of knowledge was more closely linked to philosophy than it is now, and in the Western world the term "" natural philosophy "" once encompassed fields of study that are today associated with science, such as astronomy , medicine, and physics . [5] [c] However, during the Islamic Golden Age foundations for the scientific method were laid by Ibn al-Haytham in his Book of Optics . [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] While the classification of the material world by the ancient Indians and Greeks into air, earth, fire and water was more philosophical, medieval Middle Easterns used practical and experimental observation to classify materials. [11] In the 17th and 18th centuries, scientists increasingly sought to formulate knowledge in terms of physical laws . Over the course of the 19th century, the word ""science"" became increasingly associated with the scientific method itself as a disciplined way to study the natural world. It was during this time that scientific disciplines such as biology , chemistry , and physics reached their modern shapes. That same time period also included the origin of the terms "" scientist "" and "" scientific community "", the founding of scientific institutions, and the increasing significance of their interactions with society and other aspects of culture. [12] [13] The scale of the universe mapped to the branches of science , with formal sciences as the foundation. [14] : Vol.1, Chaps.1,2,&3.

[d] Modern science is distinct in its approach and successful in its results , so it now defines what science is in the strictest sense of the term. [15] Science in its original sense was a word for a type of knowledge rather than a specialized word for the pursuit of such knowledge. In particular, it was the type of knowledge which people can communicate to each other and share. For example, knowledge about the working of natural things was gathered long before recorded history and led to the development of complex abstract thought. This is shown by the construction of complex calendars, techniques for making poisonous plants edible, and buildings such as the Pyramids . However, no consistent conscientious distinction was made between knowledge of such things, which are true in every community, and other types of communal knowledge, such as mythologies and legal systems. Antiquity See also: Nature (philosophy) Maize , known in some English-speaking countries as corn, is a large grain plant domesticated by indigenous peoples in Mesoamerica in prehistoric times Before the invention or discovery of the concept of "" nature "" ( ancient Greek phusis ) by the Pre-Socratic philosophers , the same words tend to be used to describe the natural ""way"" in which a plant grows, [16] and the ""way"" in which, for example, one tribe worships a particular god. For this reason, it is claimed these men were the first philosophers in the strict sense, and also the first people to clearly distinguish ""nature"" and ""convention."" [17] : p.209 Science was therefore distinguished as the knowledge of nature and things which are true for every community, and the name of the specialized pursuit of such knowledge was philosophy — the realm of the first philosopher-physicists. They were mainly speculators or theorists , particularly interested in astronomy . In contrast, trying to use knowledge of nature to imitate nature (artifice or technology , Greek techn? ) was seen by classical scientists as a more appropriate interest for lower class artisans. [18] A clear-cut distinction between formal ( eon ) and empirical science ( doxa ) was made by the pre-Socratic philosopher Parmenides (fl. late sixth or early fifth century BCE). Although his work Peri Physeos ( On Nature ) is a poem, it may be viewed as an epistemological essay on method in natural science. Parmenides' ??? may refer to a formal system or calculus which can describe nature more precisely than natural languages. ""Physis"" may be identical to ???. [19] Aristotle , 384 BCE – 322 BCE, one of the early figures in the development of the scientific method [20] A major turning point in the history of early philosophical science was the controversial but successful attempt by Socrates to apply philosophy to the study of human things, including human nature, the nature of political communities, and human knowledge itself. He criticized the older type of study of physics as too purely speculative and lacking in self-criticism. He was particularly concerned that some of the early physicists treated nature as if it could be assumed that it had no intelligent order, explaining things merely in terms of motion and matter. The study of human things had been the realm of mythology and tradition, however, so Socrates was executed as a heretic. [21] : 30e Aristotle later created a less controversial systematic programme of Socratic philosophy which was teleological and human-centred. He rejected many of the conclusions of earlier scientists. For example, in his physics, the sun goes around the earth, and many things have it as part of their nature that they are for humans. Each thing has a formal cause and final cause and a role in the rational cosmic order. Motion and change is described as the actualization of potentials already in things, according to what types of things they are. While the Socratics insisted that philosophy should be used to consider the practical question of the best way to live for a human being (a study Aristotle divided into ethics and political philosophy ), they did not argue for any other types of applied science . Aristotle maintained the sharp distinction between science and the practical knowledge of artisans, treating theoretical speculation as the highest type of human activity, practical thinking about good living as something less lofty, and the knowledge of artisans as something only suitable for the lower classes. In contrast to modern science, Aristotle's influential emphasis was upon the ""theoretical"" steps of deducing universal rules from raw data and did not treat the gathering of experience and raw data as part of science itself. [e] Medieval science De potentiis anime sensitive, Gregor Reisch (1504) Margarita philosophica . Medieval science postulated a ventricle of the brain as the location for our common sense , [22] where the forms from our sensory systems commingled. Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen), 965–1039 Basra , Buyid Emirate . The Muslim scholar who is considered by some to be the father of modern scientific methodology due to his emphasis on experimental data and reproducibility of its results. [23] [f] During late antiquity and the early Middle Ages , the Aristotelian approach to inquiries on natural phenomena was used. Some ancient knowledge was lost, or in some cases kept in obscurity, during the fall of the Roman Empire and periodic political struggles. However, the general fields of science (or "" natural philosophy "" as it was called) and much of the general knowledge from the ancient world remained preserved through the works of the early Latin encyclopedists like Isidore of Seville . In the Byzantine empire , many Greek science texts were preserved in Syriac translations done by groups such as the Nestorians and Monophysites. [24] Many of these were later on translated into Arabic under the Caliphate , during which many types of classical learning were preserved and in some cases improved upon. [24] [g] The House of Wisdom was established in Abbasid -era Baghdad , Iraq . [25] It is considered to have been a major intellectual center during the Islamic Golden Age , where Muslim scholars such as al-Kindi and Ibn Sahl in Baghdad and Ibn al-Haytham in Cairo flourished from the ninth to the thirteenth centuries until the Mongol sack of Baghdad. Ibn al-Haytham, known later to the West as Alhazen, furthered the Aristotelian viewpoint [26] by emphasizing experimental data. [h] [27] In the later medieval period, as demand for translations grew (for example, from the Toledo School of Translators ), western Europeans began collecting texts written not only in Latin, but also Latin translations from Greek, Arabic, and Hebrew. In particular, the texts of Aristotle, Ptolemy , [i] and Euclid , preserved in the Houses of Wisdom, were sought amongst Catholic scholars. In Europe, the Latin translation of Alhazen's Book of Optics directly influenced Roger Bacon (13th century) in England, who argued for more experimental science as demonstrated by Alhazen. By the late Middle Ages, a synthesis of Catholicism and Aristotelianism known as Scholasticism was flourishing in western Europe , which had become a new geographic center of science, but all aspects of scholasticism were criticized in the 15th and 16th centuries. Renaissance and early modern science Main article: Scientific revolution Galen (129–c. 216) noted the optic chiasm is X-shaped. (Engraving from Vesalius , 1543) Medieval science carried on the views of the Hellenist civilization of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, as shown by Alhazen's lost work A Book in which I have Summarized the Science of Optics from the Two Books of Euclid and Ptolemy, to which I have added the Notions of the First Discourse which is Missing from Ptolemy's Book from Ibn Abi Usaibia 's catalog, as cited in ( Smith 2001 ). : 91 (vol.1),p.xv Alhazen conclusively disproved Ptolemy's theory of vision, but he retained Aristotle's ontology; Roger Bacon , Vitello , and John Peckham each built up a scholastic ontology upon Alhazen's Book of Optics , a causal chain beginning with sensation, perception, and finally apperception of the individual and universal forms of Aristotle. [28] This model of vision became known as Perspectivism, which was exploited and studied by the artists of the Renaissance. Galileo Galilei , father of modern science. [29] : Vol. 24, No. 1, p. 36 A. Mark Smith points out the perspectivist theory of vision, which pivots on three of Aristotle's four causes , formal, material, and final, ""is remarkably economical, reasonable, and coherent."" [30] Although Alhacen knew that a scene imaged through an aperture is inverted, he argued that vision is about perception. This was overturned by Kepler , [31] :p.102 who modelled the eye as a water-filled glass sphere with an aperture in front of it to model the entrance pupil. He found that all the light from a single point of the scene was imaged at a single point at the back of the glass sphere. The optical chain ends on the retina at the back of the eye and the image is inverted. [j] Copernicus formulated a heliocentric model of the solar system unlike the geocentric model of Ptolemy 's Almagest . Galileo made innovative use of experiment and mathematics. However, he became persecuted after Pope Urban VIII blessed Galileo to write about the Copernican system. Galileo had used arguments from the Pope and put them in the voice of the simpleton in the work ""Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems,"" which greatly offended him. [32] In Northern Europe, the new technology of the printing press was widely used to publish many arguments, including some that disagreed widely with contemporary ideas of nature. René Descartes and Francis Bacon published philosophical arguments in favor of a new type of non-Aristotelian science. Descartes argued that mathematics could be used in order to study nature, as Galileo had done, and Bacon emphasized the importance of experiment over contemplation. Bacon questioned the Aristotelian concepts of formal cause and final cause, and promoted the idea that science should study the laws of ""simple"" natures, such as heat, rather than assuming that there is any specific nature, or "" formal cause ,"" of each complex type of thing. This new modern science began to see itself as describing "" laws of nature "". This updated approach to studies in nature was seen as mechanistic . Bacon also argued that science should aim for the first time at practical inventions for the improvement of all human life. Age of Enlightenment Isaac Newton , shown here in a 1689 portrait, made seminal contributions to classical mechanics , gravity , and optics . Newton shares credit with Gottfried Leibniz for the development of calculus. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the project of modernity, as had been promoted by Bacon and Descartes, led to rapid scientific advance and the successful development of a new type of natural science, mathematical, methodically experimental, and deliberately innovative. Newton and Leibniz succeeded in developing a new physics, now referred to as classical mechanics , which could be confirmed by experiment and explained using mathematics. Leibniz also incorporated terms from Aristotelian physics , but now being used in a new non-teleological way, for example, "" energy "" and "" potential "" (modern versions of Aristotelian "" energeia and potentia ""). In the style of Bacon, he assumed that different types of things all work according to the same general laws of nature, with no special formal or final causes for each type of thing. It is during this period that the word ""science"" gradually became more commonly used to refer to a type of pursuit of a type of knowledge, especially knowledge of nature — coming close in meaning to the old term "" natural philosophy ."" 19th century Charles Darwin in 1854, by then working towards publication of On the Origin of Species Both John Herschel and William Whewell systematized methodology: the latter coined the term scientist . [33] When Charles Darwin published On the Origin of Species he established evolution as the prevailing explanation of biological complexity. His theory of natural selection provided a natural explanation of how species originated, but this only gained wide acceptance a century later. John Dalton developed the idea of atoms . The laws of thermodynamics and the electromagnetic theory were also established in the 19th century, which raised new questions which could not easily be answered using Newton's framework. The phenomena that would allow the deconstruction of the atom were discovered in the last decade of the 19th century: the discovery of X-rays inspired the discovery of radioactivity . In the next year came the discovery of the first subatomic particle, the electron . Combustion and chemical reactions were studied by Michael Faraday and reported in his lectures before the Royal Institution : The Chemical History of a Candle , 1861 20th century and beyond A simulated event in the CMS detector of the Large Hadron Collider , featuring a possible appearance of the Higgs boson Einstein 's theory of relativity and the development of quantum mechanics led to the replacement of classical mechanics with a new physics which contains two parts that describe different types of events in nature. In the first half of the century, the development of artificial fertilizer made global human population growth possible. At the same time, the structure of the atom and its nucleus was discovered, leading to the release of "" atomic energy "" ( nuclear power ). In addition, the extensive use of scientific innovation stimulated by the wars of this century led to antibiotics and increased life expectancy, revolutions in transportation ( automobiles and aircraft ), the development of ICBMs , a space race , and a nuclear arms race , all giving a widespread public appreciation of the importance of modern science. Widespread use of integrated circuits in the last quarter of the 20th century combined with communications satellites led to a revolution in information technology and the rise of the global internet and mobile computing , including smartphones . More recently, it has been argued that the ultimate purpose of science is to make sense of human beings and our nature. For example, in his book Consilience , E. O. Wilson said: ""The human condition is the most important frontier of the natural sciences"".

Also see: Human timeline and Life timeline Main article: Scientific method The scientific method seeks to explain the events of nature in a reproducible way. [k] An explanatory thought experiment or hypothesis is put forward as explanation using principles such as parsimony (also known as "" Occam's Razor "") and are generally expected to seek consilience —fitting well with other accepted facts related to the phenomena. [1] This new explanation is used to make falsifiable predictions that are testable by experiment or observation. The predictions are to be posted before a confirming experiment or observation is sought, as proof that no tampering has occurred. Disproof of a prediction is evidence of progress. [l] [m] This is done partly through observation of natural phenomena, but also through experimentation that tries to simulate natural events under controlled conditions as appropriate to the discipline (in the observational sciences, such as astronomy or geology, a predicted observation might take the place of a controlled experiment). Experimentation is especially important in science to help establish causal relationships (to avoid the correlation fallacy ). When a hypothesis proves unsatisfactory, it is either modified or discarded. [34] If the hypothesis survived testing, it may become adopted into the framework of a scientific theory , a logically reasoned, self-consistent model or framework for describing the behavior of certain natural phenomena. A theory typically describes the behavior of much broader sets of phenomena than a hypothesis; commonly, a large number of hypotheses can be logically bound together by a single theory. Thus a theory is a hypothesis explaining various other hypotheses. In that vein, theories are formulated according to most of the same scientific principles as hypotheses. In addition to testing hypotheses, scientists may also generate a model , an attempt to describe or depict the phenomenon in terms of a logical, physical or mathematical representation and to generate new hypotheses that can be tested, based on observable phenomena. [35] While performing experiments to test hypotheses, scientists may have a preference for one outcome over another, and so it is important to ensure that science as a whole can eliminate this bias. [36] [37] This can be achieved by careful experimental design , transparency, and a thorough peer review process of the experimental results as well as any conclusions. [38] [39] After the results of an experiment are announced or published, it is normal practice for independent researchers to double-check how the research was performed, and to follow up by performing similar experiments to determine how dependable the results might be. [40] Taken in its entirety, the scientific method allows for highly creative problem solving while minimizing any effects of subjective bias on the part of its users (especially the confirmation bias ). [41] Mathematics and formal sciences Main article: Mathematics A Venn diagram illustrating the intersection of two sets . Mathematics is essential to the sciences. One important function of mathematics in science is the role it plays in the expression of scientific models. Observing and collecting measurements , as well as hypothesizing and predicting, often require extensive use of mathematics. For example, arithmetic , algebra , geometry , trigonometry , and calculus are all essential to physics . Virtually every branch of mathematics has applications in science, including ""pure"" areas such as number theory and topology . Statistical methods , which are mathematical techniques for summarizing and analyzing data, allow scientists to assess the level of reliability and the range of variation in experimental results. Statistical analysis plays a fundamental role in many areas of both the natural sciences and social sciences. Computational science applies computing power to simulate real-world situations, enabling a better understanding of scientific problems than formal mathematics alone can achieve. According to the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics , computation is now as important as theory and experiment in advancing scientific knowledge. [42] A great amount of interest was taken in the study of formal logic in the early 20th century among mathematicians and philosophers with the rise of set theory and its use for the foundations of mathematics. Notable mathematicians and philosophers who contributed to this field include: Gottlob Frege , Giuseppe Peano , George Boole , Ernst Zermelo , Abraham Fraenkel , David Hilbert , Bertrand Russell , and Alfred Whitehead among many others. Various axiomatic systems such as Peano arithmetic , the Zermelo–Fraenkel system of set theory, as well as the system in Principia Mathematica , were thought by many to prove the foundations of math. However, in 1931, with the publication of Kurt Gödel's incompleteness theorem , much of their efforts were undermined. [43] Formal logic is still studied today at universities by students of mathematics, philosophy, and computer science . For example, boolean algebra is employed by all modern computers to function, and thus is an extremely useful branch of knowledge for programmers . Whether mathematics itself is properly classified as science has been a matter of some debate. Some thinkers see mathematicians as scientists, regarding physical experiments as inessential or mathematical proofs as equivalent to experiments. Others do not see mathematics as a science because it does not require an experimental test of its theories and hypotheses. Mathematical theorems and formulas are obtained by logical derivations which presume axiomatic systems, rather than the combination of empirical observation and logical reasoning that has come to be known as the scientific method . In general, mathematics is classified as formal science , while natural and social sciences are classified as empirical sciences. [44] Scientific community Main article: Scientific community The scientific community is the group of all interacting scientists. It includes many sub-communities working on particular scientific fields, and within particular institutions; interdisciplinary and cross-institutional activities are also significant. Branches and fields Main article: Branches of science The somatosensory system is located throughout our bodies but is integrated in the brain . Scientific fields are commonly divided into two major groups: natural sciences , which study natural phenomena (including biological life ), and social sciences , which study human behavior and societies . These are both empirical sciences, which means their knowledge must be based on observable phenomena and capable of being tested for its validity by other researchers working under the same conditions. [45] There are also related disciplines that are grouped into interdisciplinary applied sciences , such as engineering and medicine . Within these categories are specialized scientific fields that can include parts of other scientific disciplines but often possess their own nomenclature and expertise. [46] Mathematics , which is classified as a formal science , [47] [48] has both similarities and differences with the empirical sciences (the natural and social sciences). It is similar to empirical sciences in that it involves an objective, careful and systematic study of an area of knowledge; it is different because of its method of verifying its knowledge, using a priori rather than empirical methods. [49] The formal sciences, which also include statistics and logic , are vital to the empirical sciences. Major advances in formal science have often led to major advances in the empirical sciences. The formal sciences are essential in the formation of hypotheses , theories , and laws , [50] both in discovering and describing how things work (natural sciences) and how people think and act (social sciences). Apart from its broad meaning, the word ""science"" sometimes may specifically refer to fundamental sciences (maths and natural sciences) alone. Science schools or faculties within many institutions are separate from those for medicine or engineering, each of which is an applied science . Institutions Learned societies for the communication and promotion of scientific thought and experimentation have existed since the Renaissance period. [51] The oldest surviving institution is the Italian Accademia dei Lincei which was established in 1603. [52] The respective National Academies of Science are distinguished institutions that exist in a number of countries, beginning with the British Royal Society in 1660 [53] and the French Académie des Sciences in 1666. [54] International scientific organizations, such as the International Council for Science , have since been formed to promote cooperation between the scientific communities of different nations. Many governments have dedicated agencies to support scientific research. Prominent scientific organizations include the National Science Foundation in the U.S. , the National Scientific and Technical Research Council in Argentina, CSIRO in Australia, Centre national de la recherche scientifique in France, the Max Planck Society and Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft in Germany, and CSIC in Spain. Literature Main article: Scientific literature An enormous range of scientific literature is published. [55] Scientific journals communicate and document the results of research carried out in universities and various other research institutions, serving as an archival record of science. The first scientific journals, Journal des Sçavans followed by the Philosophical Transactions , began publication in 1665. Since that time the total number of active periodicals has steadily increased. In 1981, one estimate for the number of scientific and technical journals in publication was 11,500. [56] The United States National Library of Medicine currently indexes 5,516 journals that contain articles on topics related to the life sciences. Although the journals are in 39 languages, 91 percent of the indexed articles are published in English. [57] Most scientific journals cover a single scientific field and publish the research within that field; the research is normally expressed in the form of a scientific paper . Science has become so pervasive in modern societies that it is generally considered necessary to communicate the achievements, news, and ambitions of scientists to a wider populace. Science magazines such as New Scientist , Science & Vie , and Scientific American cater to the needs of a much wider readership and provide a non-technical summary of popular areas of research, including notable discoveries and advances in certain fields of research. Science books engage the interest of many more people. Tangentially, the science fiction genre, primarily fantastic in nature, engages the public imagination and transmits the ideas, if not the methods, of science. Recent efforts to intensify or develop links between science and non-scientific disciplines such as literature or more specifically, poetry , include the Creative Writing Science resource developed through the Royal Literary Fund . [58] Science and society ""Science and society"" redirects here. For the academic journal, see Science & Society . Women in science Main article: Women in science Marie Curie was the first person to be awarded two Nobel Prizes : Physics in 1903 and Chemistry in 1911 [59] Science has historically been a male-dominated field, with some notable exceptions. [n] Women faced considerable discrimination in science, much as they did in other areas of male-dominated societies, such as frequently being passed over for job opportunities and denied credit for their work. [o] For example, Christine Ladd (1847–1930) was able to enter a PhD program as ""C. Ladd""; Christine ""Kitty"" Ladd completed the requirements in 1882, but was awarded her degree only in 1926, after a career which spanned the algebra of logic (see truth table ), color vision, and psychology. Her work preceded notable researchers like Ludwig Wittgenstein and Charles Sanders Peirce . The achievements of women in science have been attributed to their defiance of their traditional role as laborers within the domestic sphere . [60] In the late 20th century, active recruitment of women and elimination of institutional discrimination on the basis of sex greatly increased the number of women scientists, but large gender disparities remain in some fields; over half of new biologists are female, while 80% of PhDs in physics are given to men. [ citation needed ] Feminists claim this is the result of culture rather than an innate difference between the sexes, and some experiments have shown that parents challenge and explain more to boys than girls, asking them to reflect more deeply and logically. [61] : 258–261. In the early part of the 21st century, in America, women earned 50.3% bachelor's degrees, 45.6% master's degrees, and 40.7% of PhDs in science and engineering fields with women earning more than half of the degrees in three fields: Psychology (about 70%), Social Sciences (about 50%), and Biology (about 50-60%). However, when it comes to the Physical Sciences, Geosciences, Math, Engineering, and Computer Science, women earned less than half the degrees. [62] However, lifestyle choice also plays a major role in female engagement in science; women with young children are 28% less likely to take tenure-track positions due to work-life balance issues, [63] and female graduate students' interest in careers in research declines dramatically over the course of graduate school, whereas that of their male colleagues remains unchanged. [64] Science policy Main articles: Science policy , History of science policy , Funding of science , and Economics of science President Clinton meets the 1998 U.S. Nobel Prize winners in the White House Science policy is an area of public policy concerned with the policies that affect the conduct of the scientific enterprise, including research funding , often in pursuance of other national policy goals such as technological innovation to promote commercial product development, weapons development, health care and environmental monitoring. Science policy also refers to the act of applying scientific knowledge and consensus to the development of public policies. Science policy thus deals with the entire domain of issues that involve the natural sciences. In accordance with public policy being concerned about the well-being of its citizens, science policy's goal is to consider how science and technology can best serve the public. State policy has influenced the funding of public works and science for thousands of years, dating at least from the time of the Mohists , who inspired the study of logic during the period of the Hundred Schools of Thought , and the study of defensive fortifications during the Warring States period in China. In Great Britain , governmental approval of the Royal Society in the 17th century recognized a scientific community which exists to this day. The professionalization of science, begun in the 19th century, was partly enabled by the creation of scientific organizations such as the National Academy of Sciences , the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute , and state funding of universities of their respective nations. Public policy can directly affect the funding of capital equipment and intellectual infrastructure for industrial research by providing tax incentives to those organizations that fund research. Vannevar Bush , director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development for the United States government, the forerunner of the National Science Foundation , wrote in July 1945 that ""Science is a proper concern of government."" [65] Science and technology research is often funded through a competitive process in which potential research projects are evaluated and only the most promising receive funding. Such processes, which are run by government, corporations, or foundations, allocate scarce funds. Total research funding in most developed countries is between 1.5% and 3% of GDP . [66] In the OECD , around two-thirds of research and development in scientific and technical fields is carried out by industry, and 20% and 10% respectively by universities and government. The government funding proportion in certain industries is higher, and it dominates research in social science and humanities . Similarly, with some exceptions (e.g. biotechnology ) government provides the bulk of the funds for basic scientific research . In commercial research and development, all but the most research-oriented corporations focus more heavily on near-term commercialisation possibilities rather than "" blue-sky "" ideas or technologies (such as nuclear fusion ). Media perspectives The mass media face a number of pressures that can prevent them from accurately depicting competing scientific claims in terms of their credibility within the scientific community as a whole. Determining how much weight to give different sides in a scientific debate may require considerable expertise regarding the matter. [67] Few journalists have real scientific knowledge, and even beat reporters who know a great deal about certain scientific issues may be ignorant about other scientific issues that they are suddenly asked to cover. [68] [69] Political usage See also: Politicization of science Many issues damage the relationship of science to the media and the use of science and scientific arguments by politicians . As a very broad generalisation, many politicians seek certainties and facts whilst scientists typically offer probabilities and caveats. However, politicians' ability to be heard in the mass media frequently distorts the scientific understanding by the public. Examples in the United Kingdom include the controversy over the MMR inoculation , and the 1988 forced resignation of a Government Minister, Edwina Currie , for revealing the high probability that battery farmed eggs were contaminated with Salmonella . [70] John Horgan , Chris Mooney , and researchers from the US and Canada have described Scientific Certainty Argumentation Methods (SCAMs), where an organization or think tank makes it their only goal to cast doubt on supported science because it conflicts with political agendas. [71] [72] [73] [74] Hank Campbell and microbiologist Alex Berezow have described ""feel-good fallacies"" used in politics, especially on the left, where politicians frame their positions in a way that makes people feel good about supporting certain policies even when scientific evidence shows there is no need to worry or there is no need for dramatic change on current programs. [75] : Vol. 78 , No. 1. 2–38 Science and the public Various activities are developed to facilitate communication between the general public and science/scientists, such as science outreach , public awareness of science , science communication , science festivals , citizen science , science journalism , public science , and popular science . See Science and the public for related concepts. Science is represented by the 'S' in STEM fields . Philosophy of science See also: Philosophy of science Working scientists usually take for granted a set of basic assumptions that are needed to justify the scientific method: (1) that there is an objective reality shared by all rational observers; (2) that this objective reality is governed by natural laws; (3) that these laws can be discovered by means of systematic observation and experimentation. [15] Philosophy of science seeks a deep understanding of what these underlying assumptions mean and whether they are valid. The belief that scientific theories should and do represent metaphysical reality is known as realism . It can be contrasted with anti-realism , the view that the success of science does not depend on it being accurate about unobservable entities such as electrons . One form of anti-realism is idealism , the belief that the mind or consciousness is the most basic essence, and that each mind generates its own reality. [p] In an idealistic world view , what is true for one mind need not be true for other minds. The Sand Reckoner is a work by Archimedes in which he sets out to determine an upper bound for the number of grains of sand that fit into the universe. In order to do this, he had to estimate the size of the universe according to the contemporary model, and invent a way to analyze extremely large numbers. There are different schools of thought in philosophy of science. The most popular position is empiricism , [q] which holds that knowledge is created by a process involving observation and that scientific theories are the result of generalizations from such observations. [76] Empiricism generally encompasses inductivism , a position that tries to explain the way general theories can be justified by the finite number of observations humans can make and hence the finite amount of empirical evidence available to confirm scientific theories. This is necessary because the number of predictions those theories make is infinite, which means that they cannot be known from the finite amount of evidence using deductive logic only. Many versions of empiricism exist, with the predominant ones being Bayesianism [77] and the hypothetico-deductive method . [78] :p236 Empiricism has stood in contrast to rationalism , the position originally associated with Descartes , which holds that knowledge is created by the human intellect, not by observation. [78] :p20 Critical rationalism is a contrasting 20th-century approach to science, first defined by Austrian-British philosopher Karl Popper . Popper rejected the way that empiricism describes the connection between theory and observation. He claimed that theories are not generated by observation, but that observation is made in the light of theories and that the only way a theory can be affected by observation is when it comes in conflict with it. [78] :pp63–7 Popper proposed replacing verifiability with falsifiability as the landmark of scientific theories and replacing induction with falsification as the empirical method. [78] :p68 Popper further claimed that there is actually only one universal method, not specific to science: the negative method of criticism, trial and error . [79] It covers all products of the human mind, including science, mathematics, philosophy, and art. [80] Another approach, instrumentalism , colloquially termed ""shut up and multiply,"" [81] emphasizes the utility of theories as instruments for explaining and predicting phenomena. [82] It views scientific theories as black boxes with only their input (initial conditions) and output (predictions) being relevant. Consequences, theoretical entities, and logical structure are claimed to be something that should simply be ignored and that scientists shouldn't make a fuss about (see interpretations of quantum mechanics ). Close to instrumentalism is constructive empiricism , according to which the main criterion for the success of a scientific theory is whether what it says about observable entities is true. Paul Feyerabend advanced the idea of epistemological anarchism , which holds that there are no useful and exception-free methodological rules governing the progress of science or the growth of knowledge and that the idea that science can or should operate according to universal and fixed rules are unrealistic, pernicious and detrimental to science itself. [83] Feyerabend advocates treating science as an ideology alongside others such as religion , magic , and mythology , and considers the dominance of science in society authoritarian and unjustified. He also contended (along with Imre Lakatos ) [ discuss ] that the demarcation problem of distinguishing science from pseudoscience on objective grounds is not possible and thus fatal to the notion of science running according to fixed, universal rules. [83] Feyerabend also stated that science does not have evidence for its philosophical precepts, particularly the notion of uniformity of law and process across time and space . [84] Finally, another approach often cited in debates of scientific skepticism against controversial movements like "" creation science "" is methodological naturalism . Its main point is that a difference between natural and supernatural explanations should be made and that science should be restricted methodologically to natural explanations. [r] That the restriction is merely methodological (rather than ontological) means that science should not consider supernatural explanations itself, but should not claim them to be wrong either. Instead, supernatural explanations should be left a matter of personal belief outside the scope of science . Methodological naturalism maintains that proper science requires strict adherence to empirical study and independent verification as a process for properly developing and evaluating explanations for observable phenomena. [85] The absence of these standards, arguments from authority , biased observational studies and other common fallacies are frequently cited by supporters of methodological naturalism as characteristic of the non-science they criticize. Certainty and science The DNA double helix is a molecule that encodes the genetic instructions used in the development and functioning of all known living organisms and many viruses . A scientific theory is empirical [q] [86] and is always open to falsification if new evidence is presented. That is, no theory is ever considered strictly certain as science accepts the concept of fallibilism . [s] The philosopher of science Karl Popper sharply distinguished truth from certainty. He wrote that scientific knowledge ""consists in the search for truth,"" but it ""is not the search for certainty ... All human knowledge is fallible and therefore uncertain."" [87] :p4 New scientific knowledge rarely results in vast changes in our understanding. According to psychologist Keith Stanovich , it may be the media's overuse of words like ""breakthrough"" that leads the public to imagine that science is constantly proving everything it thought was true to be false. [88] :119–138 While there are such famous cases as the theory of relativity that required a complete reconceptualization, these are extreme exceptions. Knowledge in science is gained by a gradual synthesis of information from different experiments by various researchers across different branches of science; it is more like a climb than a leap. [88] :123 Theories vary in the extent to which they have been tested and verified, as well as their acceptance in the scientific community. [t] For example, heliocentric theory , the theory of evolution , relativity theory , and germ theory still bear the name ""theory"" even though, in practice, they are considered factual . [89] Philosopher Barry Stroud adds that, although the best definition for "" knowledge "" is contested, being skeptical and entertaining the possibility that one is incorrect is compatible with being correct. Ironically, then, the scientist adhering to proper scientific approaches will doubt themselves even once they possess the truth . [90] The fallibilist C. S. Peirce argued that inquiry is the struggle to resolve actual doubt and that merely quarrelsome, verbal, or hyperbolic doubt is fruitless [91] —but also that the inquirer should try to attain genuine doubt rather than resting uncritically on common sense. [92] He held that the successful sciences trust not to any single chain of inference (no stronger than its weakest link) but to the cable of multiple and various arguments intimately connected. [93] Stanovich also asserts that science avoids searching for a ""magic bullet""; it avoids the single-cause fallacy . This means a scientist would not ask merely ""What is the cause of ..."", but rather ""What are the most significant causes of ..."". This is especially the case in the more macroscopic fields of science (e.g. psychology , physical cosmology ). [88] :141–147 Of course, research often analyzes few factors at once, but these are always added to the long list of factors that are most important to consider. [88] :141–147 For example, knowing the details of only a person's genetics, or their history and upbringing, or the current situation may not explain a behavior, but a deep understanding of all these variables combined can be very predictive. Fringe science, pseudoscience, and junk science An area of study or speculation that masquerades as science in an attempt to claim a legitimacy that it would not otherwise be able to achieve is sometimes referred to as pseudoscience , fringe science , or junk science . [u] Physicist Richard Feynman coined the term "" cargo cult science "" for cases in which researchers believe they are doing science because their activities have the outward appearance of science but actually lack the ""kind of utter honesty"" that allows their results to be rigorously evaluated. [94] Various types of commercial advertising, ranging from hype to fraud, may fall into these categories. There can also be an element of political or ideological bias on all sides of scientific debates. Sometimes, research may be characterized as ""bad science,"" research that may be well-intended but is actually incorrect, obsolete, incomplete, or over-simplified expositions of scientific ideas. The term "" scientific misconduct "" refers to situations such as where researchers have intentionally misrepresented their published data or have purposely given credit for a discovery to the wrong person. [95] Scientific practice Astronomy became much more accurate after Tycho Brahe devised his scientific instruments for measuring angles between two celestial bodies , before the invention of the telescope. Brahe's observations were the basis for Kepler's laws . Although encyclopedias such as Pliny's (fl. 77 AD) Natural History offered purported fact, they proved unreliable. A skeptical point of view, demanding a method of proof, was the practical position taken to deal with unreliable knowledge. As early as 1000 years ago, scholars such as Alhazen ( Doubts Concerning Ptolemy ), Roger Bacon , Witelo , John Pecham , Francis Bacon (1605), and C. S. Peirce (1839–1914) provided the community to address these points of uncertainty. In particular, fallacious reasoning can be exposed, such as "" affirming the consequent ."" ""If a man will begin with certainties, he shall end in doubts; but if he will be content to begin with doubts, he shall end in certainties."" — Francis Bacon , "" The Advancement of Learning "", Book 1, v, 8 The methods of inquiry into a problem have been known for thousands of years, [96] and extend beyond theory to practice. The use of measurements , for example, is a practical approach to settle disputes in the community. John Ziman points out that intersubjective pattern recognition is fundamental to the creation of all scientific knowledge. [97] :p44 Ziman shows how scientists can identify patterns to each other across centuries; he refers to this ability as ""perceptual consensibility."" [98] :p46 He then makes consensibility, leading to consensus, the touchstone of reliable knowledge. [98] :p104 Basic and applied research Anthropogenic pollution has an effect on the Earth's environment and climate Although some scientific research is applied research into specific problems, a great deal of our understanding comes from the curiosity-driven undertaking of basic research . This leads to options for technological advance that were not planned or sometimes even imaginable. This point was made by Michael Faraday when allegedly in response to the question ""what is the use of basic research?"" he responded: ""Sir, what is the use of a new-born child?"". [99] For example, research into the effects of red light on the human eye's rod cells did not seem to have any practical purpose; eventually, the discovery that our night vision is not troubled by red light would lead search and rescue teams (among others) to adopt red light in the cockpits of jets and helicopters. [88] :106–110 In a nutshell, basic research is the search for knowledge and applied research is the search for solutions to practical problems using this knowledge. Finally, even basic research can take unexpected turns, and there is some sense in which the scientific method is built to harness luck . Research in practice Due to the increasing complexity of information and specialization of scientists, most of the cutting-edge research today is done by well-funded groups of scientists, rather than individuals. [100] D.K. Simonton notes that due to the breadth of very precise and far reaching tools already used by researchers today and the amount of research generated so far, creation of new disciplines or revolutions within a discipline may no longer be possible as it is unlikely that some phenomenon that merits its own discipline has been overlooked. Hybridizing of disciplines and finessing knowledge is, in his view, the future of science. [100] Practical impacts of scientific research Discoveries in fundamental science can be world-changing. For example: Research Impact Static electricity and magnetism ( c. 1600) Electric current (18th century) All electric appliances, dynamos, electric power stations, modern electronics , including electric lighting , television , electric heating , transcranial magnetic stimulation , deep brain stimulation , magnetic tape , loudspeaker , and the compass and lightning rod . Diffraction (1665) Optics , hence fiber optic cable (1840s), modern intercontinental communications , and cable TV and internet Germ theory (1700) Hygiene , leading to decreased transmission of infectious diseases; antibodies , leading to techniques for disease diagnosis and targeted anticancer therapies. Vaccination (1798) Leading to the elimination of most infectious diseases from developed countries and the worldwide eradication of smallpox . Photovoltaic effect (1839) Solar cells (1883), hence solar power , solar powered watches , calculators and other devices. The strange orbit of Mercury (1859) and other research leading to special (1905) and general relativity (1916) Satellite-based technology such as GPS (1973), satnav and satellite communications [v] Radio waves (1887) Radio had become used in innumerable ways beyond its better-known areas of telephony , and broadcast television (1927) and radio (1906) entertainment . Other uses included – emergency services , radar ( navigation and weather prediction ), medicine , astronomy , wireless communications , geophysics , and networking . Radio waves also led researchers to adjacent frequencies such as microwaves , used worldwide for heating and cooking food. Radioactivity (1896) and antimatter (1932) Cancer treatment (1896), Radiometric dating (1905), nuclear reactors (1942) and weapons (1945), mineral exploration , PET scans (1961), and medical research (via isotopic labeling ) X-rays (1896) Medical imaging , including computed tomography Crystallography and quantum mechanics (1900) Semiconductor devices (1906), hence modern computing and telecommunications including the integration with wireless devices: the mobile phone [v] Plastics (1907) Starting with Bakelite , many types of artificial polymers for numerous applications in industry and daily life Antibiotics (1880s, 1928) Salvarsan , Penicillin , doxycycline etc. Nuclear magnetic resonance (1930s) Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1946), magnetic resonance imaging (1971), functional magnetic resonance imaging (1990s).

The full title translation is from p.60 of James R. Voelkel (2001) Johannes Kepler and the New Astronomy Oxford University Press. Kepler was driven to this experiment after observing the partial solar eclipse at Graz, July 10, 1600. He used Tycho Brahe's method of observation, which was to project the image of the sun on a piece of paper through a pinhole aperture, instead of looking directly at the sun. He disagreed with Brahe's conclusion that total eclipses of the sun were impossible, because there were historical accounts of total eclipses. Instead he deduced that the size of the aperture controls the sharpness of the projected image (the larger the aperture, the more accurate the image — this fact is now fundamental for optical system design). Voelkel, p.61, notes that Kepler's experiments produced the first correct account of vision and the eye, because he realized he could not accurately write about astronomical observation by ignoring the eye. ^ di Francia 1976 , p. 13: ""The amazing point is that for the first time since the discovery of mathematics, a method has been introduced, the results of which have an intersubjective value!""

Having placed this board in a sloping position, by lifting one end some one or two cubits above the other, we rolled the ball, as I was just saying, along the channel, noting, in a manner presently to be described, the time required to make the descent. We . . . now rolled the ball only one-quarter the length of the channel; and having measured the time of its descent, we found it precisely one-half of the former. Next we tried other distances, comparing the time for the whole length with that for the half, or with that for two-thirds, or three-fourths, or indeed for any fraction; in such experiments, repeated many, many, times.""

The oval features are cyclones, up to 600 miles (1,000 kilometers) in diameter. Photograph: NASA/JPL-Caltech/SwRI/MSSS/Betsy Asher Hall/Gervasio Robles Jupiter Nasa's Juno probe captures dramatic first close-up images of Jupiter Excitement greets pictures of giant, chaotic weather systems plus new measurements that will help build unprecedented map of planet’s interior Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Ian Sample Science editor @iansample Thursday 25 May 2017 19.00 BST Last modified on Thursday 25 May 2017 22.00 BST The first close-up observations from Nasa’s Juno spacecraft have captured towering clouds, swirling cyclones and dramatic flows of ammonia that drive giant weather systems on the largest planet in the solar system. The $1.1bn probe swung into orbit around Jupiter in July last year on a mission to peer through the thick clouds that shroud the planet and learn how the alien world, and ultimately all of the planets in the solar system, formed around the nascent sun 4.5bn years ago. “We were all jumping up and down with excitement when the images came down,” said Fran Bagenal, a planetary space physicist at the University of Colorado, who joined the Juno mission more than a decade ago. “You’ve got to be patient, but the rewards are fantastic.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Once every 53 days the Juno spacecraft swings close to Jupiter, speeding over its clouds. In just two hours, the spacecraft travels from a perch over Jupiter’s north pole through its closest approach (perijove), then passes over the south pole on its way back out. Photograph: Credits: NASA/SWRI/MSSS/Gerald Eichstädt/Seán Doran The spacecraft survived an almost six-year, 2.8bn km voyage across the depths of space to reach its destination, where it ducked beneath Jupiter’s intense radiation belts, turned on its suite of instruments, and swept into an orbit that loops over the planet’s north and south poles. From 5,000km above the brown-orange blanket that covers the planet, Juno’s camera snapped pictures of tall, white storm clouds standing high above the rest. Some were so high, they stood out even on the nightside of the planet, betrayed by the feeble light of the sun glinting off them. Yet more images revealed flashes of lightning that illuminate the Jovian sky. “The weather is dramatic,” said Bagenal. “What we thought we knew about Jupiter , we underestimated. It’s more variable, there are more features, there is much more detail the closer you look.” Described as a “planet on steroids” by Scott Bolton, the mission’s principal investigator at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Jupiter is an enormous gas giant made from hydrogen and helium. Compared with Jupiter and the sun, the rest of the solar system is an afterthought. All of the other planets, the asteroids and comets, would fit within Jupiter, a planet 11 times wider than Earth. Writing in two papers in the journal Science today, the Juno team describe fresh images and measurements of the planet’s atmosphere, magnetic field and the brilliant non-stop lightshows that constitute the aurorae at Jupiter’s poles. Facebook Twitter Pinterest An image of the North polar region of Jupiter. Photograph: MSSS/SwRI/JPL-Caltech/NASA Its sensors peering down as it swooped around the planet, Juno spotted chaotic scenes with bright oval-shaped features swirling in the clouds. Time-lapse images revealed them to be enormous cyclones, rotating counter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere. The storms reached up to 1,400km wide, more than ten times the size of the largest cyclones on Earth. Deep inside the atmosphere, the scientists found evidence for what they called an “equatorial plume” – a massive and unexpected overturning of gas driven by a steady upward stream of ammonia from around the planet’s equator. It seems to mirror the Hadley cell convection currents on Earth, where warm air rises at the equator and falls again about 30 degrees to the north and south. But “It looks like a band that goes all the way round the middle of Jupiter,” said Bagenal. The question is where does it go down?” Another instrument on Juno measured the magnetic field of the planet and found it to be twice as strong as scientists expected, at about ten times greater than the field that surrounds Earth. During observations of the planet’s intense aurorae, Juno detected streams of electrons hurtling down into Jupiter’s upper atmosphere, where they potentially power the spectacular light shows. Over the coming months, Juno will build up an unprecedented map of the planet’s interior before its instruments succumb to the harsh radiation and the spacecraft plunges into the clouds at the end of its mission. Along for the ride are three Lego crew members : the Roman god Jupiter, his wife Juno, and a telescope-wielding Galileo, who discovered four of Jupiter’s 53 moons. One mystery scientists are keen to clear up is whether Jupiter has a solid core. With more data from the orbiting Juno, it is a puzzle they hope to answer. “We’re having to put together this 3D puzzle,” Bagenal said. “And surprise, surprise, it isn’t like Earth.” Topics Jupiter Astronomy Nasa Space news Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content View all comments > Order by newest oldest recommendations Show 25 25 50 100 All Threads collapsed expanded unthreaded Loading comments… Trouble loading?

The CC licenses and public domain tools are widely used to share scientific research and data. We’ve also created software and developed policy recommendations that make it easier for scholars and policymakers to advocate for open solutions to collaboration and information exchange. Projects Science Commons was launched in 2005 with the goal of bringing the openness and sharing that have made Creative Commons licenses a success in the arts and cultural fields to the world of science. Science Commons helped explore the intersection of the web, legal tools, and scholarly publishing for the benefit of scientific discovery, innovation, and collaboration. It has since been re-integrated with Creative Commons and is no longer a discrete project. Creative Commons launched its Scholar’s Copyright Project in June 2006, with one of the main components being the Scholar’s Copyright Addendum Engine . This tool provides a simple mechanism for scholars to retain copyright over their published material that otherwise would be transferred to the publisher. It has now re-launched and updated in beta on CC Labs . The Termination of Transfer tool has also been released in beta. Once finalized, it will help authors learn if and when they have the right to terminate agreements under U.S. law, and regain their right their right to use CC tools to publish under open access terms. Policy The practice of open science is inextricably linked to the dissemination of that research to other scientists, and the public. Much of scientific research is funded by the public, thus there has been an increasing attention to ensuring that there is broad public access to the outputs (articles and data) of publicly funded science. Thus, advocates call for open licensing requirements to be attached to publicly funded research grants. This means that articles developed as a result of public funding must be shared under a liberal open license (such as CC BY) so that everyone else is granted permission to read and re-use that publicly funded research. Such policies are already in place in the UK , and are coming online at the European level , in the United States , and elsewhere. Universities and philanthropic foundations are also adopting open licensing policies for the research articles and data sets that their faculty and grantees produce. Resources PLOS PLOS (Public Library of Science) is a nonprofit scientific and medical publishing venture that provides scientists and physicians with high-quality, high-profile journals in which to publish their most important work. Massachusetts Institute of Technology Libraries MIT Libraries offers a local version of the Scholar’s Copyright Addendum Engine , created by Creative Commons as a means of simplifying the process of implementing an addendum to retain scholarly rights when publishing.

38," Knowledge - Wikipedia Knowledge From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation , search For other uses, see Knowledge (disambiguation) . Knowledge is a familiarity, awareness, or understanding of someone or something, such as facts , information , descriptions , or skills , which is acquired through experience or education by perceiving , discovering , or learning . Knowledge can refer to a theoretical or practical understanding of a subject. It can be implicit (as with practical skill or expertise) or explicit (as with the theoretical understanding of a subject); it can be more or less formal or systematic. [1] In philosophy , the study of knowledge is called epistemology ; the philosopher Plato famously defined knowledge as "" justified true belief "", though this definition is now thought by some analytic philosophers [ citation needed ] to be problematic because of the Gettier problems while others defend the platonic definition. [2] However, several definitions of knowledge and theories to explain it exist. Knowledge acquisition involves complex cognitive processes: perception , communication , and reasoning ; [3] while knowledge is also said to be related to the capacity of acknowledgment in human beings. [4] Contents 1 Theories of knowledge 2 Communicating knowledge 3 Situated knowledge 4 Partial knowledge 5 Scientific knowledge 6 Religious meaning of knowledge 6.1 As a measure of religiosity in sociology of religion 7 See also 8 References 9 External links Theories of knowledge [ edit ] Robert Reid , Knowledge (1896). Thomas Jefferson Building , Washington, D.C. See also: Epistemology The eventual demarcation of philosophy from science was made possible by the notion that philosophy's core was ""theory of knowledge,"" a theory distinct from the sciences because it was their foundation ... Without this idea of a ""theory of knowledge,"" it is hard to imagine what ""philosophy"" could have been in the age of modern science. — Richard Rorty , Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature The definition of knowledge is a matter of ongoing debate among philosophers in the field of epistemology . The classical definition, described but not ultimately endorsed by Plato , [5] specifies that a statement must meet three criteria in order to be considered knowledge: it must be justified , true , and believed . Some claim that these conditions are not sufficient, as Gettier case examples allegedly demonstrate. There are a number of alternatives proposed, including Robert Nozick 's arguments for a requirement that knowledge 'tracks the truth' and Simon Blackburn 's additional requirement that we do not want to say that those who meet any of these conditions 'through a defect, flaw, or failure' have knowledge. Richard Kirkham suggests that our definition of knowledge requires that the evidence for the belief necessitates its truth. [6] In contrast to this approach, Ludwig Wittgenstein observed, following Moore's paradox , that one can say ""He believes it, but it isn't so,"" but not ""He knows it, but it isn't so."" [7] He goes on to argue that these do not correspond to distinct mental states, but rather to distinct ways of talking about conviction. What is different here is not the mental state of the speaker, but the activity in which they are engaged. For example, on this account, to know that the kettle is boiling is not to be in a particular state of mind, but to perform a particular task with the statement that the kettle is boiling. Wittgenstein sought to bypass the difficulty of definition by looking to the way ""knowledge"" is used in natural languages. He saw knowledge as a case of a family resemblance . Following this idea, ""knowledge"" has been reconstructed as a cluster concept that points out relevant features but that is not adequately captured by any definition. [8] Communicating knowledge [ edit ] Los portadores de la antorcha (The Torch-Bearers) – Sculpture by Anna Hyatt Huntington symbolizing the transmission of knowledge from one generation to the next ( Ciudad Universitaria, Madrid, Spain ) Symbolic representations can be used to indicate meaning and can be thought of as a dynamic process. Hence the transfer of the symbolic representation can be viewed as one ascription process whereby knowledge can be transferred. Other forms of communication include observation and imitation, verbal exchange, and audio and video recordings. Philosophers of language and semioticians construct and analyze theories of knowledge transfer or communication. While many would agree that one of the most universal and significant tools for the transfer of knowledge is writing and reading (of many kinds), argument over the usefulness of the written word exists nonetheless, with some scholars skeptical of its impact on societies. In his collection of essays Technopoly , Neil Postman demonstrates the argument against the use of writing through an excerpt from Plato's work Phaedrus (Postman, Neil (1992) Technopoly , Vintage, New York, pp 73). In this excerpt, the scholar Socrates recounts the story of Thamus, the Egyptian king and Theuth the inventor of the written word. In this story, Theuth presents his new invention ""writing"" to King Thamus, telling Thamus that his new invention ""will improve both the wisdom and memory of the Egyptians"" (Postman, Neil (1992) Technopoly, Vintage, New York, pp 74). King Thamus is skeptical of this new invention and rejects it as a tool of recollection rather than retained knowledge. He argues that the written word will infect the Egyptian people with fake knowledge as they will be able to attain facts and stories from an external source and will no longer be forced to mentally retain large quantities of knowledge themselves (Postman, Neil (1992) Technopoly , Vintage, New York,pp 74). Classical early modern theories of knowledge, especially those advancing the influential empiricism of the philosopher John Locke, were based implicitly or explicitly on a model of the mind which likened ideas to words. [9] This analogy between language and thought laid the foundation for a graphic conception of knowledge in which the mind was treated as a table, a container of content, that had to be stocked with facts reduced to letters, numbers or symbols. This created a situation in which the spatial alignment of words on the page carried great cognitive weight, so much so that educators paid very close attention to the visual structure of information on the page and in notebooks. [10] Media theorists like Andrew Robinson emphasise that the visual depiction of knowledge in the modern world was often seen as being 'truer' than oral knowledge. This plays into a longstanding analytic notion in the Western intellectual tradition in which verbal communication is generally thought to lend itself to the spread of falsehoods as much as written communication. It is harder to preserve records of what was said or who originally said it – usually neither the source nor the content can be verified. Gossip and rumors are examples prevalent in both media. As to the value of writing, the extent of human knowledge is now so great, and the people interested in a piece of knowledge so separated in time and space, that writing is considered central to capturing and sharing it. Major libraries today can have millions of books of knowledge (in addition to works of fiction). It is only recently that audio and video technology for recording knowledge have become available and the use of these still requires replay equipment and electricity. Verbal teaching and handing down of knowledge is limited to those who would have contact with the transmitter or someone who could interpret written work. Writing is still the most available and most universal of all forms of recording and transmitting knowledge. It stands unchallenged as mankind's primary technology of knowledge transfer down through the ages and to all cultures and languages of the world. [ citation needed ] [ disputed – discuss ] Situated knowledge [ edit ] Situated knowledge is knowledge specific to a particular situation. It is a term coined by Donna Haraway as an extension of the feminist approaches of ""successor science"" suggested by Sandra Harding , one which ""offers a more adequate, richer, better account of a world, in order to live in it well and in critical, reflexive relation to our own as well as others' practices of domination and the unequal parts of privilege and oppression that makes up all positions."" [11] This situation partially transforms science into a narrative , which Arturo Escobar explains as, ""neither fictions nor supposed facts."" This narrative of situation is historical textures woven of fact and fiction, and as Escobar explains further, ""even the most neutral scientific domains are narratives in this sense,"" insisting that rather than a purpose dismissing science as a trivial matter of contingency, ""it is to treat (this narrative) in the most serious way, without succumbing to its mystification as 'the truth' or to the ironic skepticism common to many critiques."" [12] Haraway's argument stems from the limitations of the human perception , as well as the overemphasis of the sense of vision in science . According to Haraway, vision in science has been, ""used to signify a leap out of the marked body and into a conquering gaze from nowhere."" This is the ""gaze that mythically inscribes all the marked bodies, that makes the unmarked category claim the power to see and not be seen, to represent while escaping representation."" [11] This causes a limitation of views in the position of science itself as a potential player in the creation of knowledge, resulting in a position of ""modest witness"". This is what Haraway terms a ""god trick"", or the aforementioned representation while escaping representation. [13] In order to avoid this, ""Haraway perpetuates a tradition of thought which emphasizes the importance of the subject in terms of both ethical and political accountability"". [14] Some methods of generating knowledge, such as trial and error , or learning from experience , tend to create highly situational knowledge. One of the main attributes of the scientific method is that the theories it generates are much less situational than knowledge gained by other methods. [ citation needed ] Situational knowledge is often embedded in language, culture, or traditions. This integration of situational knowledge is an allusion to the community, and its attempts at collecting subjective perspectives into an embodiment ""of views from somewhere."" [11] Knowledge generated through experience is called knowledge ""a posteriori"", meaning afterwards. The pure existence of a term like ""a posteriori"" means this also has a counterpart. In this case, that is knowledge ""a priori"", meaning before. The knowledge prior to any experience means that there are certain ""assumptions"" that one takes for granted. For example, if you are being told about a chair , it is clear to you that the chair is in space , that it is 3D . This knowledge is not knowledge that one can ""forget"", even someone suffering from amnesia experiences the world in 3D. [ citation needed ] Even though Haraway's arguments are largely based on feminist studies , [11] this idea of different worlds, as well as the skeptic stance of situated knowledge is present in the main arguments of post-structuralism . Fundamentally, both argue the contingency of knowledge on the presence of history ; power , and geography , as well as the rejection of universal rules or laws or elementary structures; and the idea of power as an inherited trait of objectification . [15] Partial knowledge [ edit ] One discipline of epistemology focuses on partial knowledge. In most cases, it is not possible to understand an information domain exhaustively; our knowledge is always incomplete or partial. Most real problems have to be solved by taking advantage of a partial understanding of the problem context and problem data, unlike the typical math problems one might solve at school, where all data is given and one is given a complete understanding of formulas necessary to solve them. [ citation needed ] This idea is also present in the concept of bounded rationality which assumes that in real life situations people often have a limited amount of information and make decisions accordingly. Intuition is the ability to acquire partial knowledge without inference or the use of reason . [16] An individual may ""know"" about a situation and be unable to explain the process that led to their knowledge. Scientific knowledge [ edit ] Sir Francis Bacon , "" Knowledge is Power "" The development of the scientific method has made a significant contribution to how knowledge of the physical world and its phenomena is acquired. [17] To be termed scientific, a method of inquiry must be based on gathering observable and measurable evidence subject to specific principles of reasoning and experimentation. [18] The scientific method consists of the collection of data through observation and experimentation , and the formulation and testing of hypotheses . [19] Science, and the nature of scientific knowledge have also become the subject of Philosophy . As science itself has developed, scientific knowledge now includes a broader usage [20] in the soft sciences such as biology and the social sciences — discussed elsewhere as meta-epistemology , or genetic epistemology , and to some extent related to "" theory of cognitive development "". Note that "" epistemology "" is the study of knowledge and how it is acquired. Science is ""the process used everyday to logically complete thoughts through inference of facts determined by calculated experiments."" Sir Francis Bacon was critical in the historical development of the scientific method; his works established and popularized an inductive methodology for scientific inquiry. His famous aphorism, "" knowledge is power "", is found in the Meditations Sacrae (1597). [21] Until recent times, at least in the Western tradition, it was simply taken for granted that knowledge was something possessed only by humans — and probably adult humans at that. Sometimes the notion might stretch to (ii) Society-as-such , as in (e.g.) ""the knowledge possessed by the Coptic culture"" (as opposed to its individual members), but that was not assured either. Nor was it usual to consider unconscious knowledge in any systematic way until this approach was popularized by Freud . [22] Other biological domains where ""knowledge"" might be said to reside, include: (iii) the immune system , and (iv) in the DNA of the genetic code . See the list of four ""epistemological domains"": Popper , (1975); [23] and Traill (2008: [24] Table S, page 31)—also references by both to Niels Jerne . Such considerations seem to call for a separate definition of ""knowledge"" to cover the biological systems. For biologists, knowledge must be usefully available to the system, though that system need not be conscious. Thus the criteria seem to be: The system should apparently be dynamic and self-organizing (unlike a mere book on its own ). The knowledge must constitute some sort of representation of ""the outside world"", [25] or ways of dealing with it (directly or indirectly). Some way must exist for the system to access this information quickly enough for it to be useful. Scientific knowledge may not involve a claim to certainty , maintaining skepticism means that a scientist will never be absolutely certain when they are correct and when they are not. It is thus an irony of proper scientific method that one must doubt even when correct, in the hopes that this practice will lead to greater convergence on the truth in general. [26] Religious meaning of knowledge [ edit ] In many expressions of Christianity , such as Catholicism and Anglicanism , knowledge is one of the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit . [27] The Old Testament 's tree of the knowledge of good and evil contained the knowledge that separated Man from God: ""And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil..."" ( Genesis 3:22 ) In Gnosticism , divine knowledge or gnosis is hoped to be attained. ?????? ??? (Vidya Daan) i.e. knowledge sharing is a major part of Daan , a tenet of all Dharmic Religions . [28] Hindu Scriptures present two kinds of knowledge, Paroksh Gyan and Prataksh Gyan . Paroksh Gyan (also spelled Paroksha -Jnana ) is secondhand knowledge: knowledge obtained from books, hearsay, etc. Prataksh Gyan (also spelled Prataksha-Jnana ) is the knowledge borne of direct experience, i.e., knowledge that one discovers for oneself. [29] Jnana yoga (""path of knowledge"") is one of three main types of yoga expounded by Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita . (It is compared and contrasted with Bhakti Yoga and Karma yoga .) In Islam , knowledge (Arabic: ???, ?ilm ) is given great significance. ""The Knowing"" ( al-?Al?m ) is one of the 99 names reflecting distinct attributes of God . The Qur'an asserts that knowledge comes from God ( 2:239 ) and various hadith encourage the acquisition of knowledge. Muhammad is reported to have said ""Seek knowledge from the cradle to the grave"" and ""Verily the men of knowledge are the inheritors of the prophets"". Islamic scholars, theologians and jurists are often given the title alim , meaning ""knowledgeble"". [ citation needed ] In Jewish tradition, knowledge ( Hebrew : ??? da'ath ) is considered one of the most valuable traits a person can acquire. Observant Jews recite three times a day in the Amidah ""Favor us with knowledge, understanding and discretion that come from you. Exalted are you, Existent-One, the gracious giver of knowledge."" The Tanakh states, ""A wise man gains power, and a man of knowledge maintains power"", and ""knowledge is chosen above gold"". As a measure of religiosity in sociology of religion [ edit ] According to the sociologist Mervin F. Verbit , knowledge may be understood as one of the key components of religiosity. Religious knowledge itself may be broken down into four dimensions: content frequency intensity centrality The content of one's religious knowledge may vary from person to person, as will the degree to which it may occupy the person's mind (frequency), the intensity of the knowledge, and the centrality of the information (in that religious tradition, or to that individual).

However this may lead to problems whenever the topic spills over into those excluded domains—e.g. when Kant (following Newton) dismissed Space and Time as axiomatically ""transcendental"" and ""a priori"" — a claim later disproved by Piaget's clinical studies. It also seems likely that the vexed problem of "" infinite regress "" can be largely (but not completely) solved by proper attention to how unconscious concepts are actually developed, both during infantile learning and as inherited ""pseudo-transcendentals"" inherited from the trial-and-error of previous generations.

42," Explanation - Wikipedia Explanation From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation , search For the Wallace Stevens poem, see Explanation (poem) . An explanation is a set of statements constructed to describe a set of facts which clarifies the causes , context , and consequences of those facts. This description may establish rules or laws , and may clarify the existing ones in relation to any objects, or phenomena examined. The components of an explanation can be implicit , and be interwoven with one another. An explanation is often underpinned by an understanding that is represented by different media such as music, text, and graphics. Thus, an explanation is subjected to interpretation , and discussion. In scientific research , explanation is one of several purposes for empirical research. [1] [2] Explanation is a way to uncover new knowledge, and to report relationships among different aspects of studied phenomena . Explanation attempts to answer the ""why"" and ""how"" questions. Explanations have varied explanatory power . The formal hypothesis is the theoretical tool used to verify explanation in empirical research. [3] [4] Contents 1 Arguments 2 Justification 3 Types 4 Meta-explanation 5 See also 6 Further reading 7 References 8 External links Arguments [ edit ] Main article: Argument While arguments attempt to show that something is, will be, or should be the case, explanations try to show why or how something is or will be. If Fred and Joe address the issue of whether or not Fred's cat has fleas, Joe may state: ""Fred, your cat has fleas. Observe the cat is scratching right now."" Joe has made an argument that the cat has fleas. However, if Fred and Joe agree on the fact that the cat has fleas, they may further question why this is so and put forth an explanation : ""The reason the cat has fleas is that the weather has been damp."" The difference is that the attempt is not to settle whether or not some claim is true, but to show why it is true. In this sense, arguments aim to contribute knowledge , whereas explanations aim to contribute understanding . Arguments and explanations largely resemble each other in rhetorical use. This is the cause of much difficulty in thinking critically about claims . There are several reasons for this difficulty. People often are not themselves clear on whether they are arguing for or explaining something. The same types of words and phrases are used in presenting explanations and arguments. The terms 'explain' or 'explanation,' et cetera are frequently used in arguments. Explanations are often used within arguments and presented so as to serve as arguments . A set of reasons Justification [ edit ] Main article: Theory of justification Justification is the reason why someone properly holds a belief , the explanation as to why the belief is a true one, or an account of how one knows what one knows. In much the same way arguments and explanations may be confused with each other, so too may explanations and justifications. Statements which are justifications of some action take the form of arguments. For example, attempts to justify a theft usually explain the motives (e.g., to feed a starving family). It is important to be aware when an explanation is not a justification. A criminal profiler may offer an explanation of a suspect's behavior (e.g.; the person lost their job, the person got evicted, etc.). Such statements may help us understand why the person committed the crime, however an uncritical listener may believe the speaker is trying to gain sympathy for the person and his or her actions. It does not follow that a person proposing an explanation has any sympathy for the views or actions being explained. This is an important distinction because we need to be able to understand and explain terrible events and behavior in attempting to discourage it. Types [ edit ] There are many and varied events, objects, and facts which require explanation. So too, there are many different types of explanation. Aristotle recognized at least four types of explanation. Other types of explanation are Deductive-nomological , Functional, Historical, Psychological, Reductive, Teleological, Methodological explanations. Meta-explanation [ edit ] The notion of meta-explanation is important in behavioral scenarios that involve conflicting agents. In these scenarios, implicit of or explicit conflict can be caused by contradictory agents' interests, as communicated in their explanations for why they behaved in a particular way, by a lack of knowledge of the situation, or by a mixture of explanations of multiple factors. In many cases to assess the plausibility of explanations, one must analyze two following components and their interrelations: (1) explanation at the actual object level (explanation itself) and (2) explanation at the higher level (meta-explanation). Comparative analysis of the roles of both is conducted to assess the plausibility of how agents explain the scenarios of their interactions. [5] Object-level explanation assesses the plausibility of individual claims by using a traditional approach to handle argumentative structure of a dialog. Meta-explanation links the structure of a current scenario with that of previously learned scenarios of multi-agent interaction. The scenario structure includes agents' communicative actions and argumentation defeat relations between the subjects of these actions. The data for both object-level and meta-explanation can be visually specified,and a plausibility of how agent behavior in a scenario can be visually explained. Meta-explanation in the form of machine learning of scenario structure can be augmented by conventional explanation by finding arguments in the form of defeasibility analysis of individual claims, to increase the accuracy of plausibility assessment. [6] A ratio between object-level and meta-explanation can be defined as the relative accuracy of plausibility assessment based on the former and latter sources. The groups of scenarios can then be clustered based on this ratio; hence, such a ratio is an important parameter of human behavior associated with explaining something to other humans.

Kalzium Science is the methodical study of nature including testable explanations and predictions . From classical antiquity through the 19th century, science as a type of knowledge was more closely linked to philosophy than it is now and, in fact, in the Western world , the term "" natural philosophy "" encompassed fields of study that are today associated with science, such as astronomy , medicine, and physics . However, during the Islamic Golden Age foundations for the scientific method were laid by Ibn al-Haytham in his Book of Optics . While the classification of the material world by the ancient Indians and Greeks into air, earth, fire and water was more philosophical, medieval Middle Easterns used practical, experimental observation to classify materials. Today, the ever-evolving term ""science"" refers to the pursuit of knowledge, not the knowledge itself. It is often synonymous with ""natural and physical science"" and often restricted to those branches of study relating to the phenomena of the material universe and their laws. Although the term implies exclusion of pure mathematics, many university faculties include Mathematics Departments within their Faculty of Science. The dominant sense in ordinary use has a narrower use for the term ""science."" It developed as a part of science becoming a distinct enterprise of defining the "" laws of nature ""; early examples include Kepler 's laws , Galileo 's laws , and Newton 's laws of motion . In this period it became more common to refer to natural philosophy as ""natural science."" Over the course of the 19th century, the word ""science"" became increasingly associated with the disciplined study of the natural world, including physics , chemistry , geology and biology . This sometimes left the study of human thought and society in a linguistic limbo, which was resolved by classifying these areas of academic study as social science . For example, psychology evolved from philosophy, and has grown into an area of study. Currently, there are both ""hard"" (e.g. biological psychology) and ""soft"" science (e.g. social psychology) fields within the discipline. As a result, and as is consistent with the unfolding of the study of knowledge and development of methods to establish facts, each area of psychology employs a scientific method. Reflecting the evolution of the development of knowledge and established facts and the use of the scientific method, Psychology Departments in universities are found within: Faculty of Arts and Science, Faculty of Arts, and a Faculty of Science. Similarly, several other major areas of disciplined study and knowledge exist today under the general rubric of ""science"", such as formal science and applied science . More about Science... View new selections below (purge) edit Selected article Nanotechnology comprises technological developments on the nanometer scale, usually 1 to 100 nm (1/1,000 µm , or 1/1,000,000 mm). A possible way to interpret this size is to take the width of a human hair, and imagine something ten thousand times smaller. The term has sometimes been applied to microscopic technology. Nanotechnology is any technology which exploits phenomena and structures that can only occur at the nanometer scale, which is the scale of several atoms and small molecules.

He pioneered exobiology and promoted the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence ( SETI ). He is world-famous for writing popular science books and for co-writing and presenting the award-winning 1980 television series Cosmos: A Personal Voyage , which was the most-watched PBS program until Ken Burns' The Civil War in 1990. A book to accompany the program was also published. He also wrote the novel Contact , the basis for the 1997 film of the same name starring Jodie Foster . During his lifetime, Sagan published more than 600 scientific papers and popular articles and was author, co-author, or editor of more than 20 books.

49," The brain literally starts eating itself when it doesn't get enough sleep - ScienceAlert Topics TECH HEALTH SPACE ENVIRONMENT HUMANS PHYSICS NATURE VIDEO CONNECT WITH US FACEBOOK TWITTER INSTAGRAM TUMBLR DAILY UPDATES RSS FEED ABOUT US OUR TEAM CONTACT US ADVERTISE WITH US PRIVACY POLICY TERMS & CONDITIONS © ScienceAlert Pty Ltd. All rights reserved. Iurii Stepanov/Shutterstock.com The Brain Literally Starts Eating Itself When It Doesn't Get Enough Sleep Holy crap. BEC CREW 26 MAY 2017 The reason we sleep goes far beyond simply replenishing our energy levels every 12 hours - our brains actually change states when we sleep to clear away the toxic byproducts of neural activity left behind during the day. Weirdly enough, the same process starts to occur in brains that are chronically sleep-deprived too - except it's kicked into hyperdrive. Researchers have found that persistently poor sleep causes the brain to clear a significant amount of neurons and synaptic connections, and recovering sleep might not be able to reverse the damage. A team led by neuroscientist Michele Bellesi from the Marche Polytechnic University in Italy has examined the mammalian brain's response to poor sleeping habits, and found a bizarre similarity between the well-rested and sleepless mice. Like the cells elsewhere in your body, the neurons in your brain are being constantly refreshed by two different types of glial cell - support cells that are often called the glue of the nervous system. The microglial cells are responsible for clearing out old and worn out cells via a process called phagocytosis - meaning ""to devour"" in Greek. The astrocytes' job is to prune unnecessary synapses (connections) in the brain to refresh and reshape its wiring. We've known that this process occurs when we sleep to clear away the neurological wear and tear of the day, but now it appears that the same thing happens when we start to lose sleep. But rather than being a good thing, the brain goes overboard with the clearing, and starts to harm itself instead. Think of it like the garbage being cleared out while you're asleep, versus someone coming into your house after several sleepless nights and indiscriminately tossing out your television, fridge, and family dog. ""We show for the first time that portions of synapses are literally eaten by astrocytes because of sleep loss,"" Bellesi told Andy Coghlan at New Scientist. To figure this out, the researchers imaged the brains of four groups of mice: one group was left to sleep for 6 to 8 hours (well-rested) another was periodically woken up from sleep (spontaneously awake) a third group was kept awake for an extra 8 hours (sleep-deprived) and a final group was kept awake for five days straight (chronically sleep-deprived). When the researchers compared the activity of the astrocytes across the four groups, they identified it in 5.7 percent of the synapses in the well-rested mouse brains, and 7.3 of the spontaneously awake mouse brains. In the sleep-deprived and chronically sleep-deprived mice, they noticed something different: the astrocytes had increased their activity to actually eating parts of the synapses like microglial cells eat waste - a process known as astrocytic phagocytosis. In the sleep-deprived mouse brains, the astrocytes were found to be active across 8.4 percent of the synapses, and in the chronically sleep-deprived mice, a whopping 13.5 percent of their synapses showed astrocyte activity. As Bellesi told New Scientist , most of the synapses that were getting eaten in the two groups of sleep-deprived mice were the largest ones, which tend to be the oldest and most heavily used - ""like old pieces of furniture"" - which is probably a good thing. But when the team checked the activity of the microglial cells across the four groups, they found that it had also ramped up in the chronically sleep-deprived group. And that's a worry, because unbridled microglial activity has been linked to brain diseases like Alzheimer's and other forms of neurodegeneration . ""We find that astrocytic phagocytosis, mainly of presynaptic elements in large synapses, occurs after both acute and chronic sleep loss, but not after spontaneous wake, suggesting that it may promote the housekeeping and recycling of worn components of heavily used, strong synapses,"" the researchers report. ""By contrast, only chronic sleep loss activates microglia cells and promotes their phagocytic activity ... suggesting that extended sleep disruption may prime microglia and perhaps predispose the brain to other forms of insult."" Many questions remain, such as if this process is replicated in human brains, and if catching up on sleep can reverse the damage. But the fact that Alzheimer's deaths have increased by an incredible 50 percent since 1999, together with the struggle that many of us have in getting a good night's sleep , means this is something we need to get to the bottom of - and fast. The research has been published in the Journal of Neuroscience.

55," History of science - Wikipedia History of science From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation , search For the academic journal, see History of Science (journal) . ""New science"" redirects here. For the treatise about history, see The New Science . The history of science is the study of the development of science and scientific knowledge, including both the natural sciences and social sciences . (The history of the arts and humanities is termed as the history of scholarship .) Science is a body of empirical , theoretical , and practical knowledge about the natural world , produced by scientists who emphasize the observation, explanation , and prediction of real world phenomena . Historiography of science , in contrast, studies the methods by which historians study the history of science. The English word scientist is relatively recent—first coined by William Whewell in the 19th century. [1] Previously, people investigating nature called themselves "" natural philosophers "". While empirical investigations of the natural world have been described since classical antiquity (for example, by Thales and Aristotle ), and scientific method has been employed since the Middle Ages (for example, by Ibn al-Haytham and Roger Bacon ), modern science began to develop in the early modern period , and in particular in the scientific revolution of 16th- and 17th-century Europe. [2] Traditionally, historians of science have defined science sufficiently broadly to include those earlier inquiries. [3] From the 18th century through late 20th century, the history of science, especially of the physical and biological sciences, was often presented in a progressive narrative in which true theories replaced false beliefs. [4] Some more recent historical interpretations, such as those of Thomas Kuhn , tend to portray the history of science in different terms, such as that of competing paradigms or conceptual systems in a wider matrix that includes intellectual, cultural, economic and political themes outside of science.

For example, the domestication of maize for agriculture has been dated to about 9,000 years ago in southern Mexico, before the development of writing systems . [6] [7] [8] Similarly, archaeological evidence indicates the development of astronomical knowledge in preliterate societies. [9] [10] The development of writing enabled knowledge to be stored and communicated across generations with much greater fidelity. Many ancient civilizations collected astronomical information in a systematic manner through simple observation. Though they had no knowledge of the real physical structure of the planets and stars, many theoretical explanations were proposed. Basic facts about human physiology were known in some places, and alchemy was practiced in several civilizations. [11] [12] Considerable observation of macroscopic flora and fauna was also performed. Africa [ edit ] Ancient Egypt made significant advances in astronomy, mathematics and medicine. [13] Their development of geometry was a necessary outgrowth of surveying to preserve the layout and ownership of farmland, which was flooded annually by the Nile river . The 3-4-5 right triangle and other rules of geometry were used to build rectilinear structures, and the post and lintel architecture of Egypt. Egypt was also a center of alchemy research for much of the Mediterranean . The Edwin Smith papyrus is one of the first medical documents still extant, and perhaps the earliest document that attempts to describe and analyse the brain: it might be seen as the very beginnings of modern neuroscience . However, while Egyptian medicine had some effective practices, it was not without its ineffective and sometimes harmful practices. Medical historians believe that ancient Egyptian pharmacology, for example, was largely ineffective. [14] Nevertheless, it applies the following components to the treatment of disease: examination, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis, [15] which display strong parallels to the basic empirical method of science and according to G. E. R. Lloyd [16] played a significant role in the development of this methodology. The Ebers papyrus (c. 1550 BC) also contains evidence of traditional empiricism . Ancient Near East [ edit ] Further information: Babylonian astronomy , Babylonian mathematics , Babylonian medicine , Egyptian astronomy , Egyptian mathematics , and Egyptian medicine Mesopotamian clay tablet, 492 BC. Writing allowed the recording of astronomical information. From their beginnings in Sumer (now Iraq ) around 3500 BC, the Mesopotamian people began to attempt to record some observations of the world with numerical data . But their observations and measurements were seemingly taken for purposes other than for elucidating scientific laws . A concrete instance of Pythagoras' law was recorded, as early as the 18th century BC: the Mesopotamian cuneiform tablet Plimpton 322 records a number of Pythagorean triplets (3,4,5) (5,12,13). ..., dated 1900 BC, possibly millennia before Pythagoras, but an abstract formulation of the Pythagorean theorem was not. [17] In Babylonian astronomy , records of the motions of the stars , planets , and the moon are left on thousands of clay tablets created by scribes . Even today, astronomical periods identified by Mesopotamian proto-scientists are still widely used in Western calendars such as the solar year and the lunar month . Using these data they developed arithmetical methods to compute the changing length of daylight in the course of the year and to predict the appearances and disappearances of the Moon and planets and eclipses of the Sun and Moon. Only a few astronomers' names are known, such as that of Kidinnu , a Chaldean astronomer and mathematician. Kiddinu's value for the solar year is in use for today's calendars. Babylonian astronomy was ""the first and highly successful attempt at giving a refined mathematical description of astronomical phenomena."" According to the historian A. Aaboe, ""all subsequent varieties of scientific astronomy, in the Hellenistic world, in India, in Islam, and in the West—if not indeed all subsequent endeavour in the exact sciences—depend upon Babylonian astronomy in decisive and fundamental ways."" [18] Greco-Roman world [ edit ] Main article: History of science in classical antiquity Plato's Academy . 1st century mosaic from Pompeii In Classical Antiquity , the inquiry into the workings of the universe took place both in investigations aimed at such practical goals as establishing a reliable calendar or determining how to cure a variety of illnesses and in those abstract investigations known as natural philosophy . The ancient people who are considered the first scientists may have thought of themselves as natural philosophers , as practitioners of a skilled profession (for example, physicians), or as followers of a religious tradition (for example, temple healers). The earliest Greek philosophers, known as the pre-Socratics , [19] provided competing answers to the question found in the myths of their neighbors: ""How did the ordered cosmos in which we live come to be?"" [20] The pre-Socratic philosopher Thales (640-546 BC), dubbed the ""father of science"", was the first to postulate non-supernatural explanations for natural phenomena. For example, that land floats on water and that earthquakes are caused by the agitation of the water upon which the land floats, rather than the god Poseidon. [21] Thales' student Pythagoras of Samos founded the Pythagorean school , which investigated mathematics for its own sake, and was the first to postulate that the Earth is spherical in shape. [22] Leucippus (5th century BC) introduced atomism , the theory that all matter is made of indivisible, imperishable units called atoms . This was greatly expanded on by his pupil Democritus and later Epicurus . Subsequently, Plato and Aristotle produced the first systematic discussions of natural philosophy, which did much to shape later investigations of nature. Their development of deductive reasoning was of particular importance and usefulness to later scientific inquiry. Plato founded the Platonic Academy in 387 BC, whose motto was ""Let none unversed in geometry enter here"", and turned out many notable philosophers. Plato's student Aristotle introduced empiricism and the notion that universal truths can be arrived at via observation and induction, thereby laying the foundations of the scientific method. [23] Aristotle also produced many biological writings that were empirical in nature, focusing on biological causation and the diversity of life. He made countless observations of nature, especially the habits and attributes of plants and animals in the world around him, classified more than 540 animal species, and dissected at least 50. Aristotle's writings profoundly influenced subsequent Islamic and European scholarship, though they were eventually superseded in the Scientific Revolution . Archimedes used the method of exhaustion to approximate the value of ? . The important legacy of this period included substantial advances in factual knowledge, especially in anatomy , zoology , botany , mineralogy , geography , mathematics and astronomy ; an awareness of the importance of certain scientific problems, especially those related to the problem of change and its causes; and a recognition of the methodological importance of applying mathematics to natural phenomena and of undertaking empirical research. [24] In the Hellenistic age scholars frequently employed the principles developed in earlier Greek thought: the application of mathematics and deliberate empirical research, in their scientific investigations. [25] Thus, clear unbroken lines of influence lead from ancient Greek and Hellenistic philosophers , to medieval Muslim philosophers and scientists , to the European Renaissance and Enlightenment , to the secular sciences of the modern day. Neither reason nor inquiry began with the Ancient Greeks, but the Socratic method did, along with the idea of Forms , great advances in geometry , logic , and the natural sciences. According to Benjamin Farrington , former Professor of Classics at Swansea University : ""Men were weighing for thousands of years before Archimedes worked out the laws of equilibrium; they must have had practical and intuitional knowledge of the principles involved. What Archimedes did was to sort out the theoretical implications of this practical knowledge and present the resulting body of knowledge as a logically coherent system."" and again: ""With astonishment we find ourselves on the threshold of modern science. Nor should it be supposed that by some trick of translation the extracts have been given an air of modernity. Far from it. The vocabulary of these writings and their style are the source from which our own vocabulary and style have been derived."" [26] Schematic of the Antikythera mechanism (150-100 BC). Octahedral shape of a diamond . The astronomer Aristarchus of Samos was the first known person to propose a heliocentric model of the solar system, while the geographer Eratosthenes accurately calculated the circumference of the Earth. Hipparchus (c. 190 – c. 120 BC) produced the first systematic star catalog . The level of achievement in Hellenistic astronomy and engineering is impressively shown by the Antikythera mechanism (150-100 BC), an analog computer for calculating the position of planets. Technological artifacts of similar complexity did not reappear until the 14th century, when mechanical astronomical clocks appeared in Europe. [27] In medicine , Hippocrates (c. 460 BC – c. 370 BC) and his followers were the first to describe many diseases and medical conditions and developed the Hippocratic Oath for physicians, still relevant and in use today. Herophilos (335–280 BC) was the first to base his conclusions on dissection of the human body and to describe the nervous system . Galen (129 – c. 200 AD) performed many audacious operations—including brain and eye surgeries — that were not tried again for almost two millennia. One of the oldest surviving fragments of Euclid's Elements , found at Oxyrhynchus and dated to c. 100 AD. [28] In Hellenistic Egypt , the mathematician Euclid laid down the foundations of mathematical rigor and introduced the concepts of definition, axiom, theorem and proof still in use today in his Elements , considered the most influential textbook ever written. [29] Archimedes , considered one of the greatest mathematicians of all time, [30] is credited with using the method of exhaustion to calculate the area under the arc of a parabola with the summation of an infinite series , and gave a remarkably accurate approximation of Pi . [31] He is also known in physics for laying the foundations of hydrostatics , statics , and the explanation of the principle of the lever . Theophrastus wrote some of the earliest descriptions of plants and animals, establishing the first taxonomy and looking at minerals in terms of their properties such as hardness . Pliny the Elder produced what is one of the largest encyclopedias of the natural world in 77 AD, and must be regarded as the rightful successor to Theophrastus. For example, he accurately describes the octahedral shape of the diamond , and proceeds to mention that diamond dust is used by engravers to cut and polish other gems owing to its great hardness. His recognition of the importance of crystal shape is a precursor to modern crystallography , while mention of numerous other minerals presages mineralogy . He also recognises that other minerals have characteristic crystal shapes, but in one example, confuses the crystal habit with the work of lapidaries . He was also the first to recognise that amber was a fossilized resin from pine trees because he had seen samples with trapped insects within them. India [ edit ] Main article: Science and technology in ancient India Ancient India was an early leader in metallurgy , as evidenced by the wrought-iron Pillar of Delhi . Mathematics: The earliest traces of mathematical knowledge in the Indian subcontinent appear with the Indus Valley Civilization (c. 4th millennium BC ~ c. 3rd millennium BC). The people of this civilization made bricks whose dimensions were in the proportion 4:2:1, considered favorable for the stability of a brick structure. [32] They also tried to standardize measurement of length to a high degree of accuracy. They designed a ruler—the Mohenjo-daro ruler —whose unit of length (approximately 1.32 inches or 3.4 centimetres) was divided into ten equal parts. Bricks manufactured in ancient Mohenjo-daro often had dimensions that were integral multiples of this unit of length. [33] Indian astronomer and mathematician Aryabhata (476-550), in his Aryabhatiya (499) introduced a number of trigonometric functions (including sine , versine , cosine and inverse sine), trigonometric tables , and techniques and algorithms of algebra . In 628 AD, Brahmagupta suggested that gravity was a force of attraction. [34] [35] He also lucidly explained the use of zero as both a placeholder and a decimal digit , along with the Hindu-Arabic numeral system now used universally throughout the world. Arabic translations of the two astronomers' texts were soon available in the Islamic world , introducing what would become Arabic numerals to the Islamic World by the 9th century. [36] [37] During the 14th–16th centuries, the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics made significant advances in astronomy and especially mathematics, including fields such as trigonometry and analysis . In particular, Madhava of Sangamagrama is considered the ""founder of mathematical analysis "". [38] Astronomy: The first textual mention of astronomical concepts comes from the Vedas , religious literature of India. [39] According to Sarma (2008): ""One finds in the Rigveda intelligent speculations about the genesis of the universe from nonexistence, the configuration of the universe, the spherical self-supporting earth , and the year of 360 days divided into 12 equal parts of 30 days each with a periodical intercalary month."". [39] The first 12 chapters of the Siddhanta Shiromani , written by Bh?skara in the 12th century, cover topics such as: mean longitudes of the planets; true longitudes of the planets; the three problems of diurnal rotation; syzygies; lunar eclipses; solar eclipses; latitudes of the planets; risings and settings; the moon's crescent; conjunctions of the planets with each other; conjunctions of the planets with the fixed stars; and the patas of the sun and moon. The 13 chapters of the second part cover the nature of the sphere, as well as significant astronomical and trigonometric calculations based on it. Nilakantha Somayaji 's astronomical treatise the Tantrasangraha similar in nature to the Tychonic system proposed by Tycho Brahe had been the most accurate astronomical model until the time of Johannes Kepler in the 17th century. [40] Linguistics: Some of the earliest linguistic activities can be found in Iron Age India (1st millennium BC) with the analysis of Sanskrit for the purpose of the correct recitation and interpretation of Vedic texts. The most notable grammarian of Sanskrit was P??ini (c. 520–460 BC), whose grammar formulates close to 4,000 rules which together form a compact generative grammar of Sanskrit. Inherent in his analytic approach are the concepts of the phoneme , the morpheme and the root . Medicine: Findings from Neolithic graveyards in what is now Pakistan show evidence of proto-dentistry among an early farming culture. [41] Ayurveda is a system of traditional medicine that originated in ancient India before 2500 BC, [42] and is now practiced as a form of alternative medicine in other parts of the world. Its most famous text is the Su?rutasamhit? of Su?ruta , which is notable for describing procedures on various forms of surgery , including rhinoplasty , the repair of torn ear lobes, perineal lithotomy , cataract surgery, and several other excisions and other surgical procedures. Metallurgy: The wootz , crucible and stainless steels were discovered in India, and were widely exported in Classic Mediterranean world. It was known from Pliny the Elder as ferrum indicum . Indian Wootz steel was held in high regard in Roman Empire, was often considered to be the best. After in Middle Age it was imported in Syria to produce with special techniques the "" Damascus steel "" by the year 1000. [43] The Hindus excel in the manufacture of iron, and in the preparations of those ingredients along with which it is fused to obtain that kind of soft iron which is usually styled Indian steel (Hindiah). They also have workshops wherein are forged the most famous sabres in the world. — Henry Yule quoted the 12th-century Arab Edrizi. [44] China [ edit ] Main articles: History of science and technology in China and List of Chinese discoveries Further information: Chinese mathematics and List of Chinese inventions Lui Hui's Survey of sea island Mathematics : From the earliest the Chinese used a positional decimal system on counting boards in order to calculate. To express 10, a single rod is placed in the second box from the right. The spoken language uses a similar system to English: e.g. four thousand two hundred seven. No symbol was used for zero. By the 1st century BC, negative numbers and decimal fractions were in use and The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art included methods for extracting higher order roots by Horner's method and solving linear equations and by Pythagoras' theorem . Cubic equations were solved in the Tang dynasty and solutions of equations of order higher than 3 appeared in print in 1245 AD by Ch'in Chiu-shao . Pascal's triangle for binomial coefficients was described around 1100 by Jia Xian . Although the first attempts at an axiomatisation of geometry appear in the Mohist canon in 330 BC, Liu Hui developed algebraic methods in geometry in the 3rd century AD and also calculated pi to 5 significant figures. In 480, Zu Chongzhi improved this by discovering the ratio 355 113 {\displaystyle {\tfrac {355}{113}}} which remained the most accurate value for 1200 years. One of the star maps from Su Song 's Xin Yi Xiang Fa Yao published in 1092, featuring a cylindrical projection similar to Mercator projection and the corrected position of the pole star thanks to Shen Kuo 's astronomical observations. [45] Astronomy : Astronomical observations from China constitute the longest continuous sequence from any civilisation and include records of sunspots (112 records from 364 BC), supernovas (1054), lunar and solar eclipses. By the 12th century, they could reasonably accurately make predictions of eclipses, but the knowledge of this was lost during the Ming dynasty, so that the Jesuit Matteo Ricci gained much favour in 1601 by his predictions. [46] By 635 Chinese astronomers had observed that the tails of comets always point away from the sun. From antiquity, the Chinese used an equatorial system for describing the skies and a star map from 940 was drawn using a cylindrical ( Mercator ) projection. The use of an armillary sphere is recorded from the 4th century BC and a sphere permanently mounted in equatorial axis from 52 BC. In 125 AD Zhang Heng used water power to rotate the sphere in real time. This included rings for the meridian and ecliptic. By 1270 they had incorporated the principles of the Arab torquetum . A modern replica of Zhang Heng 's seismometer of 132 CE Seismology : To better prepare for calamities, Zhang Heng invented a seismometer in 132 CE which provided instant alert to authorities in the capital Luoyang that an earthquake had occurred in a location indicated by a specific cardinal or ordinal direction . [47] Although no tremors could be felt in the capital when Zhang told the court that an earthquake had just occurred in the northwest, a message came soon afterwards that an earthquake had indeed struck 400 km (248 mi) to 500 km (310 mi) northwest of Luoyang (in what is now modern Gansu ). [48] Zhang called his device the 'instrument for measuring the seasonal winds and the movements of the Earth' (Houfeng didong yi ?????), so-named because he and others thought that earthquakes were most likely caused by the enormous compression of trapped air. [49] See Zhang's seismometer for further details. There are many notable contributors to the field of Chinese science throughout the ages. One of the best examples would be Shen Kuo (1031–1095), a polymath scientist and statesman who was the first to describe the magnetic -needle compass used for navigation , discovered the concept of true north , improved the design of the astronomical gnomon , armillary sphere , sight tube , and clepsydra , and described the use of drydocks to repair boats. After observing the natural process of the inundation of silt and the find of marine fossils in the Taihang Mountains (hundreds of miles from the Pacific Ocean), Shen Kuo devised a theory of land formation, or geomorphology . He also adopted a theory of gradual climate change in regions over time, after observing petrified bamboo found underground at Yan'an , Shaanxi province. If not for Shen Kuo's writing, [50] the architectural works of Yu Hao would be little known, along with the inventor of movable type printing , Bi Sheng (990-1051). Shen's contemporary Su Song (1020–1101) was also a brilliant polymath, an astronomer who created a celestial atlas of star maps, wrote a pharmaceutical treatise with related subjects of botany , zoology , mineralogy , and metallurgy , and had erected a large astronomical clocktower in Kaifeng city in 1088. To operate the crowning armillary sphere , his clocktower featured an escapement mechanism and the world's oldest known use of an endless power-transmitting chain drive . The Jesuit China missions of the 16th and 17th centuries ""learned to appreciate the scientific achievements of this ancient culture and made them known in Europe. Through their correspondence European scientists first learned about the Chinese science and culture."" [51] Western academic thought on the history of Chinese technology and science was galvanized by the work of Joseph Needham and the Needham Research Institute. Among the technological accomplishments of China were, according to the British scholar Needham, early seismological detectors ( Zhang Heng in the 2nd century), the water-powered celestial globe (Zhang Heng), matches , the independent invention of the decimal system , dry docks , sliding calipers , the double-action piston pump , cast iron , the blast furnace , the iron plough , the multi-tube seed drill , the wheelbarrow , the suspension bridge , the winnowing machine , the rotary fan , the parachute , natural gas as fuel, the raised-relief map , the propeller , the crossbow , and a solid fuel rocket , the multistage rocket , the horse collar , along with contributions in logic , astronomy , medicine , and other fields. However, cultural factors prevented these Chinese achievements from developing into what we might call ""modern science"". According to Needham, it may have been the religious and philosophical framework of Chinese intellectuals which made them unable to accept the ideas of laws of nature: It was not that there was no order in nature for the Chinese, but rather that it was not an order ordained by a rational personal being, and hence there was no conviction that rational personal beings would be able to spell out in their lesser earthly languages the divine code of laws which he had decreed aforetime. The Taoists , indeed, would have scorned such an idea as being too naïve for the subtlety and complexity of the universe as they intuited it. [52] Science in the Middle Ages [ edit ] With the division of the Roman Empire, the Western Roman Empire lost contact with much of its past. In the Middle East , Greek philosophy was able to find some support under the newly created Arab Empire . With the spread of Islam in the 7th and 8th centuries, a period of Muslim scholarship, known as the Islamic Golden Age , lasted until the 13th century. This scholarship was aided by several factors. The use of a single language, Arabic , allowed communication without need of a translator. Access to Greek texts from the Byzantine Empire , along with Indian sources of learning, provided Muslim scholars a knowledge base to build upon. While the Byzantine Empire still held learning centers such as Constantinople , Western Europe's knowledge was concentrated in monasteries until the development of medieval universities in the 12th and 13th centuries. The curriculum of monastic schools included the study of the few available ancient texts and of new works on practical subjects like medicine [53] and timekeeping. [54] Islamic world [ edit ] Main articles: Science in the medieval Islamic world and Timeline of science and engineering in the Islamic world See also: Alchemy and chemistry in medieval Islam , Islamic astronomy , Islamic mathematics , Islamic medicine , Islamic physics , Islamic psychological thought , and Early Muslim sociology 15th-century manuscript of Avicenna 's The Canon of Medicine . Muslim scientists placed far greater emphasis on experiment than had the Greeks . [55] This led to an early scientific method being developed in the Muslim world, where significant progress in methodology was made, beginning with the experiments of Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) on optics from c. 1000, in his Book of Optics . [56] The most important development of the scientific method was the use of experiments to distinguish between competing scientific theories set within a generally empirical orientation, which began among Muslim scientists. Ibn al-Haytham is also regarded as the father of optics, especially for his empirical proof of the intromission theory of light. Some have also described Ibn al-Haytham as the ""first scientist"" for his development of the modern scientific method. [57] In mathematics , the mathematician Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi gave his name to the concept of the algorithm , while the term algebra is derived from al-jabr , the beginning of the title of one of his publications. What is now known as Arabic numerals originally came from India, but Muslim mathematicians did make several refinements to the number system, such as the introduction of decimal point notation. Mathematician Al-Battani (850-929) contributed to astronomy and mathematics, while scholar Al-Razi contributed to chemistry and medicine. In astronomy , Al-Battani improved the measurements of Hipparchus , preserved in the translation of Ptolemy 's Hè Megalè Syntaxis ( The great treatise ) translated as Almagest . Al-Battani also improved the precision of the measurement of the precession of the Earth's axis. The corrections made to the geocentric model by al-Battani, Ibn al-Haytham , [58] Averroes and the Maragha astronomers such as Nasir al-Din al-Tusi , Mo'ayyeduddin Urdi and Ibn al-Shatir are similar to Copernican heliocentric model. [59] [60] Heliocentric theories may have also been discussed by several other Muslim astronomers such as Ja'far ibn Muhammad Abu Ma'shar al-Balkhi , [61] Abu-Rayhan Biruni , Abu Said al-Sijzi , [62] Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi , and Najm al-D?n al-Qazw?n? al-K?tib? . [63] Muslim chemists and alchemists played an important role in the foundation of modern chemistry . Scholars such as Will Durant [64] and Fielding H. Garrison [65] considered Muslim chemists to be the founders of chemistry. In particular, J?bir ibn Hayy?n is ""considered by many to be the father of chemistry"". [66] [67] The works of Arabic scientists influenced Roger Bacon (who introduced the empirical method to Europe, strongly influenced by his reading of Persian writers), [68] and later Isaac Newton . [69] Ibn Sina ( Avicenna ) is regarded as the most influential philosopher of Islam. [70] He pioneered the science of experimental medicine [71] and was the first physician to conduct clinical trials. [72] His two most notable works in medicine are the Kit?b al-shif?? (""Book of Healing"") and The Canon of Medicine , both of which were used as standard medicinal texts in both the Muslim world and in Europe well into the 17th century. Amongst his many contributions are the discovery of the contagious nature of infectious diseases, [71] and the introduction of clinical pharmacology. [73] Some of the other famous scientists from the Islamic world include al-Farabi ( polymath ), Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi (pioneer of surgery ), [74] Ab? Rayh?n al-B?r?n? (pioneer of Indology , [75] geodesy and anthropology ), [76] Nas?r al-D?n al-T?s? (polymath), and Ibn Khaldun (forerunner of social sciences [77] such as demography , [78] cultural history , [79] historiography , [80] philosophy of history and sociology ), [81] among many others. Islamic science began its decline in the 12th or 13th century, before the Renaissance in Europe, and due in part to the 11th–13th century Mongol conquests , during which libraries, observatories, hospitals and universities were destroyed. [82] The end of the Islamic Golden Age is marked by the destruction of the intellectual center of Baghdad , the capital of the Abbasid caliphate in 1258. [82] Europe [ edit ] Main articles: European science in the Middle Ages and Byzantine science Further information: Renaissance of the 12th century , Scholasticism , Medieval technology , List of medieval European scientists , and Islamic contributions to Medieval Europe Map of medieval universities . An intellectual revitalization of Europe started with the birth of medieval universities in the 12th century. The contact with the Islamic world in Spain and Sicily , and during the Reconquista and the Crusades , allowed Europeans access to scientific Greek and Arabic texts, including the works of Aristotle , Ptolemy , J?bir ibn Hayy?n , al-Khwarizmi , Alhazen , Avicenna , and Averroes . European scholars had access to the translation programs of Raymond of Toledo , who sponsored the 12th century Toledo School of Translators from Arabic to Latin. Later translators like Michael Scotus would learn Arabic in order to study these texts directly. The European universities aided materially in the translation and propagation of these texts and started a new infrastructure which was needed for scientific communities. In fact, European university put many works about the natural world and the study of nature at the center of its curriculum, [83] with the result that the ""medieval university laid far greater emphasis on science than does its modern counterpart and descendent."" [84] As well as this, Europeans began to venture further and further east (most notably, perhaps, Marco Polo ) as a result of the Pax Mongolica . This led to the increased awareness of Indian and even Chinese culture and civilization within the European tradition. Technological advances were also made, such as the early flight of Eilmer of Malmesbury (who had studied Mathematics in 11th century England), [85] and the metallurgical achievements of the Cistercian blast furnace at Laskill . [86] [87] Statue of Roger Bacon at the Oxford University Museum . At the beginning of the 13th century, there were reasonably accurate Latin translations of the main works of almost all the intellectually crucial ancient authors, allowing a sound transfer of scientific ideas via both the universities and the monasteries. By then, the natural philosophy contained in these texts began to be extended by notable scholastics such as Robert Grosseteste , Roger Bacon , Albertus Magnus and Duns Scotus . Precursors of the modern scientific method, influenced by earlier contributions of the Islamic world, can be seen already in Grosseteste's emphasis on mathematics as a way to understand nature, and in the empirical approach admired by Bacon, particularly in his Opus Majus . Pierre Duhem 's provocative thesis of the Catholic Church's Condemnation of 1277 led to the study of medieval science as a serious discipline, ""but no one in the field any longer endorses his view that modern science started in 1277"". [88] However, many scholars agree with Duhem's view that the Middle Ages were a period of important scientific developments. [89] [90] [91] [92] The first half of the 14th century saw much important scientific work being done, largely within the framework of scholastic commentaries on Aristotle's scientific writings. [93] William of Ockham introduced the principle of parsimony : natural philosophers should not postulate unnecessary entities, so that motion is not a distinct thing but is only the moving object [94] and an intermediary ""sensible species"" is not needed to transmit an image of an object to the eye. [95] Scholars such as Jean Buridan and Nicole Oresme started to reinterpret elements of Aristotle's mechanics. In particular, Buridan developed the theory that impetus was the cause of the motion of projectiles, which was a first step towards the modern concept of inertia . [96] The Oxford Calculators began to mathematically analyze the kinematics of motion, making this analysis without considering the causes of motion. [97] In 1348, the Black Death and other disasters sealed a sudden end to the previous period of massive philosophic and scientific development. Yet, the rediscovery of ancient texts was improved after the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, when many Byzantine scholars had to seek refuge in the West. Meanwhile, the introduction of printing was to have great effect on European society. The facilitated dissemination of the printed word democratized learning and allowed a faster propagation of new ideas. New ideas also helped to influence the development of European science at this point: not least the introduction of Algebra . These developments paved the way for the Scientific Revolution , which may also be understood as a resumption of the process of scientific inquiry, halted at the start of the Black Death. Impact of science in Europe [ edit ] Main articles: Scientific revolution and Age of Enlightenment See also: Continuity thesis , Decline of Western alchemy , and Natural magic Isaac Newton initiated classical mechanics in physics . Galileo Galilei , father of modern science. [98] The renewal of learning in Europe, that began with 12th century Scholasticism , came to an end about the time of the Black Death, and the initial period of the subsequent Italian Renaissance is sometimes seen as a lull in scientific activity. The Northern Renaissance , on the other hand, showed a decisive shift in focus from Aristoteleian natural philosophy to chemistry and the biological sciences (botany, anatomy, and medicine). [99] Thus modern science in Europe was resumed in a period of great upheaval: the Protestant Reformation and Catholic Counter-Reformation ; the discovery of the Americas by Christopher Columbus ; the Fall of Constantinople ; but also the re-discovery of Aristotle during the Scholastic period presaged large social and political changes. Thus, a suitable environment was created in which it became possible to question scientific doctrine, in much the same way that Martin Luther and John Calvin questioned religious doctrine. The works of Ptolemy (astronomy) and Galen (medicine) were found not always to match everyday observations. Work by Vesalius on human cadavers found problems with the Galenic view of anatomy. [100] The willingness to question previously held truths and search for new answers resulted in a period of major scientific advancements, now known as the Scientific Revolution . The Scientific Revolution is traditionally held by most historians to have begun in 1543, when the books De humani corporis fabrica ( On the Workings of the Human Body ) by Andreas Vesalius , and also De Revolutionibus , by the astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus , were first printed. The thesis of Copernicus' book was that the Earth moved around the Sun. The period culminated with the publication of the Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica in 1687 by Isaac Newton , representative of the unprecedented growth of scientific publications throughout Europe. Other significant scientific advances were made during this time by Galileo Galilei , Edmond Halley , Robert Hooke , Christiaan Huygens , Tycho Brahe , Johannes Kepler , Gottfried Leibniz , and Blaise Pascal . In philosophy, major contributions were made by Francis Bacon , Sir Thomas Browne , René Descartes , and Thomas Hobbes . The scientific method was also better developed as the modern way of thinking emphasized experimentation and reason over traditional considerations. Age of Enlightenment [ edit ] Main article: Science in the Age of Enlightenment Further information: Age of Enlightenment Distinguished Men of Science. [101] Use your cursor to see who is who. [102] Alessandro Volta demonstrates the first electrical cell to Napoleon in 1801. The Age of Enlightenment was a European affair. The 17th century brought decisive steps towards modern science, which accelerated during the 18th century. Directly based on the works [103] of Newton , Descartes , Pascal and Leibniz , the way was now clear to the development of modern mathematics , physics and technology by the generation of Benjamin Franklin (1706–1790), Leonhard Euler (1707–1783), Mikhail Lomonosov (1711–1765) and Jean le Rond d'Alembert (1717–1783). Denis Diderot 's Encyclopédie , published between 1751 and 1772 brought this new understanding to a wider audience. The impact of this process was not limited to science and technology, but affected philosophy ( Immanuel Kant , David Hume ), religion (the increasingly significant impact of science upon religion ), and society and politics in general ( Adam Smith , Voltaire ). The early modern period is seen as a flowering of the European Renaissance, in what is often known as the Scientific Revolution , viewed as a foundation of modern science . [104] Romanticism in science [ edit ] Main article: Romanticism in science The Romantic Movement of the early 19th century reshaped science by opening up new pursuits unexpected in the classical approaches of the Enlightenment. Major breakthroughs came in biology, especially in Darwin's theory of evolution , as well as physics (electromagnetism), mathematics (non-Euclidean geometry, group theory) and chemistry (organic chemistry). The decline of Romanticism occurred because a new movement, Positivism , began to take hold of the ideals of the intellectuals after 1840 and lasted until about 1880. Modern science [ edit ] The scientific revolution established science as a source for the growth of knowledge. [ clarification needed ] [105] During the 19th century, the practice of science became professionalized and institutionalized in ways that continued through the 20th century. As the role of scientific knowledge grew in society, it became incorporated with many aspects of the functioning of nation-states. [ citation needed ] Natural sciences [ edit ] Physics [ edit ] Main article: History of physics Albert Einstein James Clerk Maxwell The scientific revolution is a convenient boundary between ancient thought and classical physics. Nicolaus Copernicus revived the heliocentric model of the solar system described by Aristarchus of Samos . This was followed by the first known model of planetary motion given by Johannes Kepler in the early 17th century, which proposed that the planets follow elliptical orbits, with the Sun at one focus of the ellipse. Galileo ("" Father of Modern Physics "") also made use of experiments to validate physical theories, a key element of the scientific method. William Gilbert did some of the earliest experiments with electricity and magnetism, establishing that the Earth itself is magnetic. In 1687, Isaac Newton published the Principia Mathematica , detailing two comprehensive and successful physical theories: Newton's laws of motion , which led to classical mechanics; and Newton's Law of Gravitation , which describes the fundamental force of gravity. During the early 19th century, the behavior of electricity and magnetism was studied by Faraday , Ohm , and others. These studies led to the unification of the two phenomena into a single theory of electromagnetism , by James Clerk Maxwell (known as Maxwell's equations ). The beginning of the 20th century brought the start of a revolution in physics. The long-held theories of Newton were shown not to be correct in all circumstances. Beginning in 1900, Max Planck , Albert Einstein , Niels Bohr and others developed quantum theories to explain various anomalous experimental results, by introducing discrete energy levels. Not only did quantum mechanics show that the laws of motion did not hold on small scales, but even more disturbingly, the theory of general relativity , proposed by Einstein in 1915, showed that the fixed background of spacetime , on which both Newtonian mechanics and special relativity depended, could not exist. In 1925, Werner Heisenberg and Erwin Schrödinger formulated quantum mechanics , which explained the preceding quantum theories. The observation by Edwin Hubble in 1929 that the speed at which galaxies recede positively correlates with their distance, led to the understanding that the universe is expanding, and the formulation of the Big Bang theory by Georges Lemaître . The atomic bomb ushered in "" Big Science "" in physics . In 1938 Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann discovered nuclear fission with radiochemical methods, and in 1939 Lise Meitner and Otto Robert Frisch wrote the first theoretical interpretation of the fission process, which was later improved by Niels Bohr and John A. Wheeler . Further developments took place during World War II, which led to the practical application of radar and the development and use of the atomic bomb . Though the process had begun with the invention of the cyclotron by Ernest O. Lawrence in the 1930s, physics in the postwar period entered into a phase of what historians have called "" Big Science "", requiring massive machines, budgets, and laboratories in order to test their theories and move into new frontiers. The primary patron of physics became state governments, who recognized that the support of ""basic"" research could often lead to technologies useful to both military and industrial applications. Currently, general relativity and quantum mechanics are inconsistent with each other, and efforts are underway to unify the two. Chemistry [ edit ] Main article: History of chemistry Dmitri Mendeleev Modern chemistry emerged from the sixteenth through the eighteenth centuries through the material practices and theories promoted by alchemy, medicine, manufacturing and mining. [106] A decisive moment came when 'chemistry' was distinguished from alchemy by Robert Boyle in his work The Sceptical Chymist , in 1661; although the alchemical tradition continued for some time after his work. Other important steps included the gravimetric experimental practices of medical chemists like William Cullen , Joseph Black , Torbern Bergman and Pierre Macquer and through the work of Antoine Lavoisier ( Father of Modern Chemistry ) on oxygen and the law of conservation of mass , which refuted phlogiston theory . The theory that all matter is made of atoms, which are the smallest constituents of matter that cannot be broken down without losing the basic chemical and physical properties of that matter, was provided by John Dalton in 1803, although the question took a hundred years to settle as proven. Dalton also formulated the law of mass relationships. In 1869, Dmitri Mendeleev composed his periodic table of elements on the basis of Dalton's discoveries. The synthesis of urea by Friedrich Wöhler opened a new research field, organic chemistry , and by the end of the 19th century, scientists were able to synthesize hundreds of organic compounds. The later part of the 19th century saw the exploitation of the Earth's petrochemicals, after the exhaustion of the oil supply from whaling . By the 20th century, systematic production of refined materials provided a ready supply of products which provided not only energy, but also synthetic materials for clothing, medicine, and everyday disposable resources. Application of the techniques of organic chemistry to living organisms resulted in physiological chemistry , the precursor to biochemistry . The 20th century also saw the integration of physics and chemistry, with chemical properties explained as the result of the electronic structure of the atom. Linus Pauling 's book on The Nature of the Chemical Bond used the principles of quantum mechanics to deduce bond angles in ever-more complicated molecules. Pauling's work culminated in the physical modelling of DNA , the secret of life (in the words of Francis Crick , 1953). In the same year, the Miller–Urey experiment demonstrated in a simulation of primordial processes, that basic constituents of proteins, simple amino acids , could themselves be built up from simpler molecules. Geology [ edit ] Main article: History of geology Geology existed as a cloud of isolated, disconnected ideas about rocks, minerals, and landforms long before it became a coherent science. Theophrastus ' work on rocks, Peri lith?n , remained authoritative for millennia: its interpretation of fossils was not overturned until after the Scientific Revolution. Chinese polymath Shen Kua (1031–1095) first formulated hypotheses for the process of land formation. Based on his observation of fossils in a geological stratum in a mountain hundreds of miles from the ocean, he deduced that the land was formed by erosion of the mountains and by deposition of silt. Plate tectonics — seafloor spreading and continental drift illustrated on a relief globe Geology did not undergo systematic restructuring during the Scientific Revolution , but individual theorists made important contributions. Robert Hooke , for example, formulated a theory of earthquakes, and Nicholas Steno developed the theory of superposition and argued that fossils were the remains of once-living creatures. Beginning with Thomas Burnet 's Sacred Theory of the Earth in 1681, natural philosophers began to explore the idea that the Earth had changed over time. Burnet and his contemporaries interpreted Earth's past in terms of events described in the Bible, but their work laid the intellectual foundations for secular interpretations of Earth history. James Hutton , the father of modern geology Modern geology, like modern chemistry, gradually evolved during the 18th and early 19th centuries. Benoît de Maillet and the Comte de Buffon saw the Earth as much older than the 6,000 years envisioned by biblical scholars. Jean-Étienne Guettard and Nicolas Desmarest hiked central France and recorded their observations on some of the first geological maps. Aided by chemical experimentation, naturalists such as Scotland's John Walker , [107] Sweden's Torbern Bergman, and Germany's Abraham Werner created comprehensive classification systems for rocks and minerals—a collective achievement that transformed geology into a cutting edge field by the end of the eighteenth century. These early geologists also proposed a generalized interpretations of Earth history that led James Hutton , Georges Cuvier and Alexandre Brongniart , following in the steps of Steno , to argue that layers of rock could be dated by the fossils they contained: a principle first applied to the geology of the Paris Basin. The use of index fossils became a powerful tool for making geological maps, because it allowed geologists to correlate the rocks in one locality with those of similar age in other, distant localities. Over the first half of the 19th century, geologists such as Charles Lyell , Adam Sedgwick , and Roderick Murchison applied the new technique to rocks throughout Europe and eastern North America, setting the stage for more detailed, government-funded mapping projects in later decades. Midway through the 19th century, the focus of geology shifted from description and classification to attempts to understand how the surface of the Earth had changed. The first comprehensive theories of mountain building were proposed during this period, as were the first modern theories of earthquakes and volcanoes. Louis Agassiz and others established the reality of continent-covering ice ages , and ""fluvialists"" like Andrew Crombie Ramsay argued that river valleys were formed, over millions of years by the rivers that flow through them. After the discovery of radioactivity , radiometric dating methods were developed, starting in the 20th century. Alfred Wegener 's theory of ""continental drift"" was widely dismissed when he proposed it in the 1910s, but new data gathered in the 1950s and 1960s led to the theory of plate tectonics , which provided a plausible mechanism for it. Plate tectonics also provided a unified explanation for a wide range of seemingly unrelated geological phenomena. Since 1970 it has served as the unifying principle in geology. Geologists' embrace of plate tectonics became part of a broadening of the field from a study of rocks into a study of the Earth as a planet. Other elements of this transformation include: geophysical studies of the interior of the Earth, the grouping of geology with meteorology and oceanography as one of the ""earth sciences"", and comparisons of Earth and the solar system's other rocky planets. Astronomy [ edit ] Main article: History of astronomy Aristarchus of Samos published work on how to determine the sizes and distances of the Sun and the Moon, and Eratosthenes used this work to figure the size of the Earth. Hipparchus later discovered the precession of the Earth. Advances in astronomy and in optical systems in the 19th century resulted in the first observation of an asteroid ( 1 Ceres ) in 1801, and the discovery of Neptune in 1846. George Gamow , Ralph Alpher , and Robert Herman had calculated that there should be evidence for a Big Bang in the background temperature of the universe. [108] In 1964, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson [109] discovered a 3 Kelvin background hiss in their Bell Labs radiotelescope (the Holmdel Horn Antenna ), which was evidence for this hypothesis, and formed the basis for a number of results that helped determine the age of the universe . Supernova SN1987A was observed by astronomers on Earth both visually, and in a triumph for neutrino astronomy , by the solar neutrino detectors at Kamiokande . But the solar neutrino flux was a fraction of its theoretically expected value . This discrepancy forced a change in some values in the standard model for particle physics .

He identified the central role of the heart, arteries, and veins in producing blood movement in a circuit, and failed to find any confirmation of Galen's pre-existing notions of heating and cooling functions. [110] The British Royal Society had received a letter from Antonie van Leeuwenhoek and published it in 1673, bringing to light the scientist's observations of microscopic organisms with his custom crafted lenses. [111] In 1847, Hungarian physician Ignác Fülöp Semmelweis dramatically reduced the occurrency of puerperal fever by simply requiring physicians to wash their hands before attending to women in childbirth. This discovery predated the germ theory of disease . However, Semmelweis' findings were not appreciated by his contemporaries and came into use only with discoveries by British surgeon Joseph Lister , who in 1865 proved the principles of antisepsis . Lister's work was based on the important findings by French biologist Louis Pasteur . Pasteur was able to link microorganisms with disease, revolutionizing medicine. He also devised one of the most important methods in preventive medicine , when in 1880 he produced a vaccine against rabies . Pasteur invented the process of pasteurization , to help prevent the spread of disease through milk and other foods. [112] Perhaps the most prominent, controversial and far-reaching theory in all of science has been the theory of evolution by natural selection put forward by the British naturalist Charles Darwin in his book On the Origin of Species in 1859. Darwin proposed that the features of all living things, including humans, were shaped by natural processes over long periods of time. The theory of evolution in its current form affects almost all areas of biology. [113] Implications of evolution on fields outside of pure science have led to both opposition and support from different parts of society, and profoundly influenced the popular understanding of ""man's place in the universe"". In the early 20th century, the study of heredity became a major investigation after the rediscovery in 1900 of the laws of inheritance developed by the Moravian [114] monk Gregor Mendel in 1866. Mendel's laws provided the beginnings of the study of genetics , which became a major field of research for both scientific and industrial research. By 1953, James D. Watson , Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins clarified the basic structure of DNA, the genetic material for expressing life in all its forms. [115] In the late 20th century, the possibilities of genetic engineering became practical for the first time, and a massive international effort began in 1990 to map out an entire human genome (the Human Genome Project ). Ecology [ edit ] Main article: History of ecology Earthrise over the Moon , Apollo 8 , NASA . This image helped create awareness of the finiteness of Earth, and the limits of its natural resources . The discipline of ecology typically traces its origin to the synthesis of Darwinian evolution and Humboldtian biogeography , in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Equally important in the rise of ecology, however, were microbiology and soil science —particularly the cycle of life concept, prominent in the work Louis Pasteur and Ferdinand Cohn . The word ecology was coined by Ernst Haeckel , whose particularly holistic view of nature in general (and Darwin's theory in particular) was important in the spread of ecological thinking. In the 1930s, Arthur Tansley and others began developing the field of ecosystem ecology , which combined experimental soil science with physiological concepts of energy and the techniques of field biology . The history of ecology in the 20th century is closely tied to that of environmentalism ; the Gaia hypothesis , first formulated in the 1960s, and spreading in the 1970s, and more recently the scientific-religious movement of Deep Ecology have brought the two closer together. Social sciences [ edit ] Main article: History of the social sciences Successful use of the scientific method in the physical sciences led to the same methodology being adapted to better understand the many fields of human endeavor. From this effort the social sciences have been developed. Political science [ edit ] Main article: History of political science Political science is a late arrival in terms of social sciences [ citation needed ] . However, the discipline has a clear set of antecedents such as moral philosophy , political philosophy , political economy , history, and other fields concerned with normative determinations of what ought to be and with deducing the characteristics and functions of the ideal form of government . The roots of politics are in prehistory . In each historic period and in almost every geographic area, we can find someone studying politics and increasing political understanding. In Western culture , the study of politics is first found in Ancient Greece . The antecedents of European politics trace their roots back even earlier than Plato and Aristotle , particularly in the works of Homer , Hesiod , Thucydides , Xenophon , and Euripides . Later, Plato analyzed political systems, abstracted their analysis from more literary - and history- oriented studies and applied an approach we would understand as closer to philosophy . Similarly, Aristotle built upon Plato's analysis to include historical empirical evidence in his analysis. An ancient Indian treatise on statecraft , economic policy and military strategy by Kautilya [116] and Vi?h?ugupta , [117] who are traditionally identified with Ch??akya (c. 350–-283 BCE). In this treatise, the behaviors and relationships of the people, the King, the State, the Government Superintendents, Courtiers, Enemies, Invaders, and Corporations are analysed and documented. Roger Boesche describes the Artha??stra as ""a book of political realism, a book analysing how the political world does work and not very often stating how it ought to work, a book that frequently discloses to a king what calculating and sometimes brutal measures he must carry out to preserve the state and the common good."" [118] During the rule of Rome, famous historians such as Polybius , Livy and Plutarch documented the rise of the Roman Republic , and the organization and histories of other nations, while statesmen like Julius Caesar , Cicero and others provided us with examples of the politics of the republic and Rome's empire and wars. The study of politics during this age was oriented toward understanding history, understanding methods of governing, and describing the operation of governments. With the fall of the Western Roman Empire , there arose a more diffuse arena for political studies. The rise of monotheism and, particularly for the Western tradition, Christianity , brought to light a new space for politics and political action [ citation needed ] . During the Middle Ages , the study of politics was widespread in the churches and courts. Works such as Augustine of Hippo 's The City of God synthesized current philosophies and political traditions with those of Christianity , redefining the borders between what was religious and what was political. Most of the political questions surrounding the relationship between Church and State were clarified and contested in this period. In the Middle East and later other Islamic areas, works such as the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam and Epic of Kings by Ferdowsi provided evidence of political analysis, while the Islamic Aristotelians such as Avicenna and later Maimonides and Averroes , continued Aristotle 's tradition of analysis and empiricism , writing commentaries on Aristotle's works. During the Italian Renaissance , Niccolò Machiavelli established the emphasis of modern political science on direct empirical observation of political institutions and actors. Later, the expansion of the scientific paradigm during the Enlightenment further pushed the study of politics beyond normative determinations [ citation needed ] . In particular, the study of statistics , to study the subjects of the state , has been applied to polling and voting . In the 20th century, the study of ideology, behaviouralism and international relations led to a multitude of 'pol-sci' subdisciplines including rational choice theory , voting theory , game theory (also used in economics), psephology , political geography / geopolitics , political psychology / political sociology , political economy , policy analysis , public administration , comparative political analysis and peace studies /conflict analysis. Linguistics [ edit ] Main article: History of linguistics Historical linguistics emerged as an independent field of study at the end of the 18th century. Sir William Jones proposed that Sanskrit , Persian , Greek , Latin , Gothic , and Celtic languages all shared a common base. After Jones, an effort to catalog all languages of the world was made throughout the 19th century and into the 20th century. Publication of Ferdinand de Saussure 's Cours de linguistique générale created the development of descriptive linguistics . Descriptive linguistics, and the related structuralism movement caused linguistics to focus on how language changes over time, instead of just describing the differences between languages. Noam Chomsky further diversified linguistics with the development of generative linguistics in the 1950s. His effort is based upon a mathematical model of language that allows for the description and prediction of valid syntax . Additional specialties such as sociolinguistics , cognitive linguistics , and computational linguistics have emerged from collaboration between linguistics and other disciplines. Economics [ edit ] Main article: History of economics The supply and demand model Adam Smith wrote The Wealth of Nations , the first modern work of economics The basis for classical economics forms Adam Smith 's An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations , published in 1776. Smith criticized mercantilism , advocating a system of free trade with division of labour . He postulated an "" invisible hand "" that regulated economic systems made up of actors guided only by self-interest. Karl Marx developed an alternative economic theory, called Marxian economics . Marxian economics is based on the labor theory of value and assumes the value of good to be based on the amount of labor required to produce it. Under this assumption, capitalism was based on employers not paying the full value of workers labor to create profit. The Austrian school responded to Marxian economics by viewing entrepreneurship as driving force of economic development. This replaced the labor theory of value by a system of supply and demand . In the 1920s, John Maynard Keynes prompted a division between microeconomics and macroeconomics . Under Keynesian economics macroeconomic trends can overwhelm economic choices made by individuals. Governments should promote aggregate demand for goods as a means to encourage economic expansion. Following World War II, Milton Friedman created the concept of monetarism . Monetarism focuses on using the supply and demand of money as a method for controlling economic activity. In the 1970s, monetarism has adapted into supply-side economics which advocates reducing taxes as a means to increase the amount of money available for economic expansion. Other modern schools of economic thought are New Classical economics and New Keynesian economics . New Classical economics was developed in the 1970s, emphasizing solid microeconomics as the basis for macroeconomic growth. New Keynesian economics was created partially in response to New Classical economics, and deals with how inefficiencies in the market create a need for control by a central bank or government. The above ""history of economics"" reflects modern economic textbooks and this means that the last stage of a science is represented as the culmination of its history ( Kuhn , 1962). The "" invisible hand "" mentioned in a lost page in the middle of a chapter in the middle of the "" Wealth of Nations "", 1776, advances as Smith's central message. [ clarification needed ] It is played down that this ""invisible hand"" acts only ""frequently"" and that it is ""no part of his [the individual's] intentions"" because competition leads to lower prices by imitating ""his"" invention. That this ""invisible hand"" prefers ""the support of domestic to foreign industry"" is cleansed—often without indication that part of the citation is truncated. [119] The opening passage of the ""Wealth"" containing Smith's message is never mentioned as it cannot be integrated into modern theory: ""Wealth"" depends on the division of labour which changes with market volume and on the proportion of productive to Unproductive labor . Psychology [ edit ] Main article: History of psychology The end of the 19th century marks the start of psychology as a scientific enterprise. The year 1879 is commonly seen as the start of psychology as an independent field of study. In that year Wilhelm Wundt founded the first laboratory dedicated exclusively to psychological research (in Leipzig ). Other important early contributors to the field include Hermann Ebbinghaus (a pioneer in memory studies), Ivan Pavlov (who discovered classical conditioning ), William James , and Sigmund Freud . Freud's influence has been enormous, though more as cultural icon than a force in scientific psychology. The 20th century saw a rejection of Freud's theories as being too unscientific, and a reaction against Edward Titchener 's atomistic approach of the mind. This led to the formulation of behaviorism by John B. Watson , which was popularized by B.F. Skinner . Behaviorism proposed epistemologically limiting psychological study to overt behavior, since that could be reliably measured. Scientific knowledge of the ""mind"" was considered too metaphysical, hence impossible to achieve. The final decades of the 20th century have seen the rise of a new interdisciplinary approach to studying human psychology, known collectively as cognitive science . Cognitive science again considers the mind as a subject for investigation, using the tools of psychology , linguistics , computer science , philosophy , and neurobiology . New methods of visualizing the activity of the brain, such as PET scans and CAT scans , began to exert their influence as well, leading some researchers to investigate the mind by investigating the brain, rather than cognition. These new forms of investigation assume that a wide understanding of the human mind is possible, and that such an understanding may be applied to other research domains, such as artificial intelligence . Sociology [ edit ] Main article: History of sociology Ibn Khaldun can be regarded as the earliest scientific systematic sociologist. [120] The modern sociology, emerged in the early 19th century as the academic response to the modernization of the world. Among many early sociologists (e.g., Émile Durkheim ), the aim of sociology was in structuralism , understanding the cohesion of social groups, and developing an ""antidote"" to social disintegration. Max Weber was concerned with the modernization of society through the concept of rationalization , which he believed would trap individuals in an ""iron cage"" of rational thought. Some sociologists, including Georg Simmel and W. E. B. Du Bois , utilized more microsociological , qualitative analyses. This microlevel approach played an important role in American sociology, with the theories of George Herbert Mead and his student Herbert Blumer resulting in the creation of the symbolic interactionism approach to sociology. American sociology in the 1940s and 1950s was dominated largely by Talcott Parsons , who argued that aspects of society that promoted structural integration were therefore ""functional"". This structural functionalism approach was questioned in the 1960s, when sociologists came to see this approach as merely a justification for inequalities present in the status quo. In reaction, conflict theory was developed, which was based in part on the philosophies of Karl Marx . Conflict theorists saw society as an arena in which different groups compete for control over resources. Symbolic interactionism also came to be regarded as central to sociological thinking. Erving Goffman saw social interactions as a stage performance, with individuals preparing ""backstage"" and attempting to control their audience through impression management . While these theories are currently prominent in sociological thought, other approaches exist, including feminist theory , post-structuralism , rational choice theory , and postmodernism . Anthropology [ edit ] Main article: History of anthropology Anthropology can best be understood as an outgrowth of the Age of Enlightenment . It was during this period that Europeans attempted systematically to study human behaviour. Traditions of jurisprudence, history, philology and sociology developed during this time and informed the development of the social sciences of which anthropology was a part. At the same time, the romantic reaction to the Enlightenment produced thinkers such as Johann Gottfried Herder and later Wilhelm Dilthey whose work formed the basis for the culture concept which is central to the discipline. Traditionally, much of the history of the subject was based on colonial encounters between Western Europe and the rest of the world, and much of 18th- and 19th-century anthropology is now classed as forms of scientific racism . During the late 19th-century, battles over the ""study of man"" took place between those of an ""anthropological"" persuasion (relying on anthropometrical techniques) and those of an "" ethnological "" persuasion (looking at cultures and traditions), and these distinctions became part of the later divide between physical anthropology and cultural anthropology , the latter ushered in by the students of Franz Boas . In the mid-20th century, much of the methodologies of earlier anthropological and ethnographical study were reevaluated with an eye towards research ethics, while at the same time the scope of investigation has broadened far beyond the traditional study of ""primitive cultures"" (scientific practice itself is often an arena of anthropological study). The emergence of paleoanthropology , a scientific discipline which draws on the methodologies of paleontology , physical anthropology and ethology , among other disciplines, and increasing in scope and momentum from the mid-20th century, continues to yield further insights into human origins, evolution, genetic and cultural heritage, and perspectives on the contemporary human predicament as well. Emerging disciplines [ edit ] During the 20th century, a number of interdisciplinary scientific fields have emerged. Examples include: Communication studies combines animal communication , information theory , marketing , public relations , telecommunications and other forms of communication. Computer science , built upon a foundation of theoretical linguistics , discrete mathematics , and electrical engineering , studies the nature and limits of computation. Subfields include computability , computational complexity , database design, computer networking , artificial intelligence , and the design of computer hardware . One area in which advances in computing have contributed to more general scientific development is by facilitating large-scale archiving of scientific data . Contemporary computer science typically distinguishes itself by emphasising mathematical 'theory' in contrast to the practical emphasis of software engineering . Environmental science is an interdisciplinary field. It draws upon the disciplines of biology, chemistry, earth sciences , ecology, geography, mathematics, and physics. Materials science has its roots in metallurgy , mineralogy , and crystallography . It combines chemistry, physics, and several engineering disciplines. The field studies metals, ceramics , glass , plastics , semiconductors , and composite materials . Academic study [ edit ] Main article: History of science and technology As an academic field, history of science and technology began with the publication of William Whewell 's History of the Inductive Sciences (first published in 1837). A more formal study of the history of science as an independent discipline was launched by George Sarton 's publications, Introduction to the History of Science (1927) and the Isis journal (founded in 1912). Sarton exemplified the early 20th-century view of the history of science as the history of great men and great ideas. He shared with many of his contemporaries a Whiggish belief in history as a record of the advances and delays in the march of progress. The history of science was not a recognized subfield of American history in this period, and most of the work was carried out by interested scientists and physicians rather than professional historians. [121] With the work of I. Bernard Cohen at Harvard, the history of science became an established subdiscipline of history after 1945. [122] The history of mathematics , history of technology , and history of philosophy are distinct areas of research and are covered in other articles. Mathematics is closely related to but distinct from natural science (at least in the modern conception). Technology is likewise closely related to but clearly differs from the search for empirical truth. History of science is an academic discipline, with an international community of specialists. Main professional organizations for this field include the History of Science Society , the British Society for the History of Science , and the European Society for the History of Science . Theories and sociology of the history of science [ edit ] Main article: Theories and sociology of the history of science Much of the study of the history of science has been devoted to answering questions about what science is , how it functions , and whether it exhibits large-scale patterns and trends. [123] The sociology of science in particular has focused on the ways in which scientists work, looking closely at the ways in which they ""produce"" and ""construct"" scientific knowledge. Since the 1960s, a common trend in science studies (the study of the sociology and history of science) has been to emphasize the ""human component"" of scientific knowledge, and to de-emphasize the view that scientific data are self-evident, value-free, and context-free. [124] The field of Science and Technology Studies , an area that overlaps and often informs historical studies of science, focuses on the social context of science in both contemporary and historical periods. Humboldtian science refers to the early 19th century approach of combining scientific field work with the age of Romanticism sensitivity, ethics and aesthetic ideals. [125] It helped to install natural history as a separate field, gave base for ecology and was based on the role model of scientist, naturalist and explorer Alexander von Humboldt . [126] The later 19th century positivism asserted that all authentic knowledge allows verification and that all authentic knowledge assumes that the only valid knowledge is scientific. [127] A major subject of concern and controversy in the philosophy of science has been the nature of theory change in science. Karl Popper argued that scientific knowledge is progressive and cumulative; Thomas Kuhn , that scientific knowledge moves through "" paradigm shifts "" and is not necessarily progressive; and Paul Feyerabend , that scientific knowledge is not cumulative or progressive and that there can be no demarcation in terms of method between science and any other form of investigation. [128] The mid 20th century saw a series of studies relying to the role of science in a social context , starting from Thomas Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions in 1962. It opened the study of science to new disciplines by suggesting that the evolution of science was in part sociologically determined and that positivism did not explain the actual interactions and strategies of the human participants in science. As Thomas Kuhn put it, the history of science may be seen in more nuanced terms, such as that of competing paradigms or conceptual systems in a wider matrix that includes intellectual, cultural, economic and political themes outside of science. ""Partly by selection and partly by distortion, the scientists of earlier ages are implicitly presented as having worked upon the same set of fixed problems and in accordance with the same set of fixed canons that the most recent revolution in scientific theory and method made seem scientific."" [129] Further studies, e.g. Jerome Ravetz 1971 Scientific Knowledge and its Social Problems referred to the role of the scientific community, as a social construct, in accepting or rejecting (objective) scientific knowledge. [130] The Science wars of the 1990 were about the influence of especially French philosophers, which denied the objectivity of science in general or seemed to do so. They described as well differences between the idealized model of a pure science and the actual scientific practice; while scientism , a revival of the positivism approach, saw in precise measurement and rigorous calculation the basis for finally settling enduring metaphysical and moral controversies. [131] [132] However, more recently some of the leading critical theorists have recognized that their postmodern deconstructions have at times been counter-productive, and are providing intellectual ammunition for reactionary interests. Bruno Latour noted that ""dangerous extremists are using the very same argument of social construction to destroy hard-won evidence that could save our lives. Was I wrong to participate in the invention of this field known as science studies? Is it enough to say that we did not really mean what we meant?"" [133] The Plight of Many Scientific Innovators [ edit ] See also: List of overlooked scientific innovators One recurring observation in the history of science involves the struggle for recognition of first-rate scientists working on the periphery of the scientific establishment. For instance, the great physicist Lord Rayleigh looked back (cited here ) on John James Waterston 's seminal paper on the kinetic theory of gases. The history of the neglect of Waterston's path-breaking article, Rayleigh felt, suggests that ""a young author who believes himself capable of great things would usually do well to secure favourable recognition of the scientific world . . . before embarking upon higher flights."" William Harvey 's experiences led him to an even more pessimistic view: [134] ""But what remains to be said about the quantity and source of the blood which thus passes, is of so novel and unheard-of character that I not only fear injury to myself from the envy of a few, but I tremble lest I have mankind at large for my enemies, so much doth wont and custom, that become as another nature, and doctrine once sown and that hath struck deep root, and respect for antiquity, influence all men."" In more general terms, Robert K. Merton [135] remarks that ""the history of science abounds in instances [136] of basic papers having been written by comparatively unknown scientists, only to be rejected or neglected for years.""

He generally, indeed,] neither intends to promote the general [Smith said ""public""] interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. [By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry,] he intends only his own security, [and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only] his own gain; and he is in this, [as in many other cases,] led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. [Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it.] By pursuing his own interest, he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it"" Samuelson, Paul A./Nordhaus, William D., 1989, Economics , 13th edition, N.Y. et al.: McGraw-Hill, page 825; Smith, Adam, 1937, The Wealth of Nations, N.

The creature, found in the Amazonian lowlands of Ecuador, has green spots across its back and a ‘red heart fully visible’ underneath, thanks to the transparent membrane around its organs. While it isn’t the only see-through species in existence, scientists say its markings, unusual call, and reproductive behaviour set it apart from the rest – but, they warn it may be in danger, as oil extraction and other human activities threaten its habitat. 4 comments 11 shares Researchers discover glass frog so translucent you can see its heart The melting glacier that released a 6.7 gigaton 'megawave' of water so strong it warped the Earth's crust The study found that during Greenland's hottest summers on record, 2010 and 2012, the ice in Rink Glacier on the island's west coast slid through the glacier's interior in a gigantic wave comments 25 shares The melting glacier that released a 6.7 gigaton 'megawave' of water Android inventor Andy Rubin teases 'Essential' AR phone he hopes will take on Apple and Google Andy Rubin has revealed a glimpse of his firm's new handset with what appears to be a radical tiny 360 degree camera plugged into the top. 9 comments 1 video 14 shares Android inventorto unveil AR phone to take on Apple and Google Trump's budget cuts would kill off West Coast quake warning system, scientists warn President Donald Trump's budget proposal would cut funding for the ShakeAlert earthquake early warning system for California, Oregon and Washington state. 26 comments 1 video 18 shares Trump's budget cuts West Coast quake warning system funding NASA to reveal new details on groundbreaking mission to 'touch the Sun' Solar Probe Plus will see a spacecraft orbit within four million miles of the sun’s blazing-hot surface, according to NASA.

Initially experts were baffled where these strange bursts of energy were coming from with some speculating it could be a sign of alien life trying to contact us. However, researchers now believe the young stars are 6200 light years from the centre of the small galaxy called FRB 121102. The FRBs are caused by flares from the dense core of a young neutron star left behind when the mother star explodes.
