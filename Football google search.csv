Please help to improve this article by introducing more precise citations. (October 2015) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) Cricket is a popular team sport played at international level Ice hockey is the most popular winter team sport [ citation needed ] Based on the number of participating athletes, bandy is the second most popular winter sport in the world [1] A team sport includes any sport which involves two or more players working together towards a shared objective. A team sport is an activity in which individuals are organized into opposing teams which compete to win. Examples are basketball , volleyball , water polo , handball , lacrosse , cricket , baseball , and the various forms of football and hockey . Contents 1 Overview 2 History 3 Olympic team sports 4 See also 5 References Overview [ edit ] Team sports are practiced between opposing teams, where the players interact directly and simultaneously between them to achieve an objective. The objective generally involves teammates facilitating the movement of a ball or similar object in accordance with a set of rules, in order to score points. However, other types of team sports do not involve teammates facilitating the movement of a ball or similar item in accordance with a set of rules, in order to score points. For example, swimming , rowing , sailing , dragon boat racing , and track and field among others are also team sports. [2] In other types of team sports there may not be an opposing team or point scoring, for example, mountaineering . Instead of points scored against an opposing team, the relative difficulty of the climb or walk is the measure of the achievement. In some sports where participants are entered by a team, they do not only compete against members of other teams but also against each other for points towards championship standings. For example, motorsport , particularly Formula One . In cycling however, team members whilst still in competition with each other, will also work towards assisting one, usually a specialist, member of the team to the highest possible finishing position. This process is known as team orders and although previously accepted was banned in Formula One [3] between 2002 and 2010. After a controversy involving team orders at the 2010 German Grand Prix however, the regulation was removed as of the 2011 season. [4] History [ edit ] Main article: History of sport Sprinting as a team sport has ancient history of several thousand years as evidenced in the engravings on the cave in Lascaux in France which depicts people running after animals or vice versa; this was an issue of survival of the fittest. [5] Ancient Greek wrestlers Rock paintings of humans in the cave of swimmers Organized sports in athletics, started in Greece in 776 BC, is recorded up to 393 BC. These games, which are Olympic games, were a form to test the skills of warriors, consisted of running , jumping or leaping, wrestling (combat sport), and javelin throw. [6] In the Bayankhongor Province of Mongolia cave paintings dating back to Neolithic age of 7000 BC depict a wrestling match surrounded by crowds. [7] Cave paintings of the Prehistoric times in Japan show a sport similar to sumo wrestling. [8] In Wadi Sura , near Gilf Kebir in Libya , Neolithic in the cave of swimmers shows evidence of swimming in a rock painting and archery being practiced around 6000 BC. [9] The terem ""athlete"" is derived from Aethelius , the King of Elis in Olympia , Greece. The practice of carrying flaming torches by young athletes is also traced to the King of Elis, under whose super vision the games were held; it is claimed by some Historians as the first record of Olympic Sprint racing. Before the start of the races gods were invoked by offering of mostly fruits and vegetables. The winner of the race was crowned with a wreath of olive or laurel and cereal sticks were offered as a trophy. In subsequent years monetary attractions were introduced as prize money. However, the practice of offering celery sticks is still in vogue in the 100 m sprint in the Olympics. [6] The present pattern of Olympic Games is akin to the practice followed in the ancient days. Sprint was the coveted event. The 200 m sprint is known in Greek as ""short foot race"". The 400 m race is equivalent to two stades and called Diaulos in Greek. [6] Olympic team sports [ edit ] Seven team sports are currently on the program of the Summer Olympics . Cricket 's inclusion in the 2024 Summer Olympics depends on the decision of the International Cricket Council and its members. [10] A cricket tournament formed part of the Summer Olympics in 1900 , although only one match was played, between teams representing Great Britain and France. However, the British team was effectively a club touring side and the French players were drawn partly from expatriates living in Paris. [11] Ice hockey and curling are team sports at the Winter Olympics together with the bobsleigh competition where the men's event has classes for both two-man and four-man sleds, but the women's class is restricted to two persons only. [12] All Olympic team sports include competitions for both men and women.

Without them, the season just wouldn't go the same way. By whatever measure, it would likely get worse -- maybe unimaginably so. While every team likes to believe it's bigger than one player, there are still some who have considerable value. That's why we've ranked the 17 most irreplaceable players who will take the field for the 2017 season. Before going further, there are some guidelines: Players need to have played at least one season in college. True freshmen and redshirt freshmen are excluded. Next, lists are always incomplete. There are excellent football players who aren't mentioned here. It happens. Apologies in advance for any angst this may cause. But ""excellent"" doesn't equal ""irreplaceable."" So what does? ""Irreplaceable"" is tough to define because it's so subjective. Is it production? Leadership? Skill set? The answer is somewhere in the ""all of the above"" option. The blueprint was to highlight players who have unique talents and value that can't be duplicated by another individual or committee. Put another way, what these players bring to their respective teams is something only they can bring. Finally, all choices you disagreed with, especially if vehemently, were courtesy of Tom Fornelli . Let's get to it. The list 17. Marcus Baugh , TE, Ohio State Buckeyes : Future breakout stars occasionally cross over into irreplaceable-land. Such is the case with Baugh, a tight end who moves like a wideout. He's shown impressive flashes of athleticism for someone listed at 6-foot-5 and 250 pounds. The fact that he can run and move in a way that many tight ends can't is critical for a Buckeyes' passing attack that, to put it lightly, features an unproven receiving corps. Baugh has been historically underutilized, but he should benefit from playing under new offensive coordinator Kevin Wilson -- a real Xs and Os genius -- who also happens to be his position coach. 16. Sam Darnold , QB, USC: Darnold is an exceptional talent and coach Clay Helton's decision not to start him at the beginning of last year is baffling in hindsight. Darnold doesn't just bring mobility, he brings confidence and poise while he's scrambling. You don't get that every day, especially from a younger player who is still in their relative infancy of playing the position. But I also tend to think we remember his final touchdown in the Rose Bowl first and foremost while neglecting the realization that he's nowhere near as good as he can be. Would there be a drop-off without him? Probably, but that's true for many teams with their starting quarterback. 15. Harold Landry , DE, Boston College Eagles : He led the nation in sacks last season on a team that finished last in the ACC Atlantic and needed to win its final two regular-season games to make a bowl. That's pretty much all you need to know. 14. Derrius Guice , RB, LSU Tigers : Leonard Fournette earned irreplaceable status last year, but as we saw, Guice was more than capable of picking up the slack with Fournette tending to injuries. So ... second time's the charm? LSU was blessed with Fournette and Guice as the top two rushing options. In that sense, maybe Fournette was more replaceable than previously thought. The difference here is there might not be another Guice-caliber option behind Guice. Either way, Guice is a large bulk of LSU's offense with question marks at quarterback. LSU will lean heavily on Guice to carry the load this season. USATSI 13. Josh Allen , QB, Wyoming Cowboys : Allen, once a no one, is ascending to the top of the 2018 draft boards. He's single-handedly putting a spotlight on Wyoming that hasn't been there in a long, long time. Maybe ever. And yeah, he's darn good, too. If anyone stayed up late to watch some after-midnight Mountain West coverage, you probably saw Allen make some highlight-worthy plays. He's big, has a rocket arm and can move. He is the mold of the ideal college quarterback today. Craig Bohl is a phenomenal coach, but Allen has a huge hand in elevating the program. You're going to hear a lot about him over the next year in a Carson Wentz-type comparison. 12. James Washington , WR, Oklahoma State Cowboys : The Big 12 was loaded at pass-catcher last season and no one was going to outshine Oklahoma Sooners 's Dede Westbrook . While that meant fewer kudos for Washington, he still returns as the Big 12's top wideout. And goodness, can take the top off a defense. The combination of a strong-armed quarterback ( Mason Rudolph ) and running game defenses have to respect is important for Washington's role. Still, he's the guy who creates explosive plays, and explosive plays are key to winning. His 19.44 yards-per-reception mark was one of the best in the nation last year among receivers with at least 50 catches. 11. Courtland Sutton , WR, SMU: Pound for pound, Sutton could be the top wideout in next year's NFL Draft . He's all of 6-foot-4 and 215 pounds, so he's a mismatch for almost any defender (especially those in the AAC) unlucky enough to be lined up across from him. Southern Methodist Mustangs has plenty of receivers to catch the ball, but none of them command a defense's attention like Sutton, who caught 76 balls for 1,246 yards last season. He is a pure matchup nightmare that you don't see often in college football . 10. Cameron Smith , LB, Southern California Trojans : Darnold, listed above, is going to get all the attention between now and Week 1 of the season as the Heisman Trophy contender. He's earned that type of offseason love. However, Smith is the quarterback of the defense -- and he's a more advanced player than Darnold at this stage in terms of what he's asked to do (and can do). Smith was the team's leading tackler last season after finishing second in the same category as a freshman in 2015. There's plenty of talent on USC's defense, but if Smith goes out of the game, that unit loses its glue. 9. Malik Jefferson , LB, Texas Longhorns : No, this isn't a ranking in name only. Jefferson remains the lifeblood at Texas despite the overall lackluster performances by the Longhorns. He's supremely gifted physically even though he's still finding his niche and growing into his body. His move to the weak side cater to his strengths at rushing the passer. There's still an element of potential to Jefferson's game, but if he continues to grow, he can be one of the most disruptive linebackers in college football. Plus, there's no ambassador for the program on the recruiting trail quite like Jefferson. He is the face of the Texas football team. Jefferson remains the face of the Longhorns' program. USATSI 8. Da'Ron Payne, DT, Alabama Crimson Tide : Another year, another loaded Alabama defense. Just when you think the Crimson Tide have lost too many key players to the NFL Draft, another handful emerge as top-flight talents for the following season. There are a few key components returning for Alabama's defense, but Payne is an absolute stud in the interior of the D-line (not to mention he's appropriately named). According to AL.com , Payne's recent workouts included a 635-pound squat, 545-pound bench press and a 365-pound power clean. He also ran the 40-yard dash in five seconds at 310 pounds. He's a freak and the anchor for one of the best run defenses in all of college football. 7. Mike McGlinchey , OL, Notre Dame Fighting Irish : He can play both tackle positions, he's a fifth-year senior on a team that desperately needs leadership, and he's protecting a new starting quarterback. Oh, and he's a heck of an athlete at 6-foot-8 and 312 pounds. Without McGlinchey, Notre Dame's offense is probably an unmitigated mess in 2017. 6. Ed Oliver , DT, Houston Cougars : Here were the numbers for Oliver in 2016: 66 tackles (third on the team) 22.5 tackles for loss (first on the team) and five sacks (third on the team). Additionally, he had nine pass break-ups and seven quarterback hurries. That was as a defensive tackle -- and as a true freshman. The production is off the charts and he absolutely made good on his hype as a blue-chip prospect. Additionally, he also forces opposing offenses to play around him. If you run at him, he'll stop you. If you double-team him, someone else finds a gap in the line (and that's if the double-team even works). He's so fast sideline to sideline that even sweeping something to the edges isn't guaranteed to be successful. He's a rare talent. 5. Baker Mayfield , QB, Oklahoma: Mayfield is a quarterback of the backyard football gunslinger mold. He'll make a play that simply wasn't there a moment before. Not many quarterbacks can do that to the level Mayfield does. And, yeah, he'll make a bad throw now and then. He'll force a throw. He'll take a sack when he should have thrown the ball away. But he's a numbers machine in the Sooners' offense, routinely tallying more than 4,000 yards. More importantly -- and this cannot be overstated -- he's the heartbeat of the team. Kyler Murray might be able to put up nice numbers if he's asked to take over, but you don't just replace Mayfield's leadership and bravado. It's Mayfield's show in Norman this year. USATSI 4. Christian Wilkins , DL, Clemson Tigers : Like Payne, Wilkins is a mind-boggling freak of an athlete along the D-line. There are plenty of studs for the Tigers in the trenches, but Wilkins can play inside and out, attacking the backfield from a variety of spots. And at 311 pounds? They just don't make 'em like that very often. Even at a place like Clemson that's developing a reputation as ""D-line U,"" players of Wilkins' caliber are hard to come by. 3. Derwin James , DB, Florida State Seminoles : James missed almost all of last season with a knee injury, but I don't think this ranking is an overinflation. He is a unique defender because he thrives at all three levels. He's built like a linebacker, has exceptional closing speed in pass coverage, lays the wood in tackling and can effectively rush the backfield. That's not the same thing as being a tweener; James is a pure defensive back who just so happens to do everything, and well. Put it this way: If there was one player I was drafting to build a defense around, it would be Derwin James. 2. Saquon Barkley , RB, Penn State Nittany Lions : It's not just that he's the centerpiece of Penn State's offense as the team's leading rusher. That's important, but it only tells part of the story. Barkley is as complete a runner as you're going to find. He has size, power, vision, footwork, agility, burst, straight-line speed ... all of it. He's like if somebody started up ""NCAA Football,"" went to Create A Player, selected running back and gave him all 99s. Barkley has the build and qualities of a power back, but he can turn defenders around in a phone booth and find creases like a smaller back. He is the truth. 1. Lamar Jackson , QB, Louisville Cardinals : There'd have to be a hell of a good reason to leave the reigning Heisman Trophy winner off this list and at least a good explanation if he's somewhere lower than third. Jackson, by himself, was worth a lot of wins. That's irreplaceable, but it goes beyond that. Last season, Jackson played on level so comically above everyone else that the Heisman race was legitimately over by November. It was briefly 2010 Cam Newton-esque. As it so happens, November was Jackson's worst month, but Jackson's good was so good that no one could offer legitimate competition without totally kidding themselves. It's all about Lamar Jackson at Louisville. USATSI Honorable mentions Jake Browning , QB, Washington Huskies : Littering a list with quarterbacks is an easy habit to fall into, but here's why Browning missed the cut: The best thing he does is throw the deep ball. It worked beautifully last season because John Ross was streaking down the field at 4.22 speed to catch it. Does Washington have another player who can fill Ross' shoes as that type of deep threat? Maybe it's Dante Pettis . Maybe it's someone else. But, if it's no one, I wonder if the best part of Browning's game will be utilized as much. J.T. Barrett, QB, Ohio State: Barrett gets a nod because he's been around long enough to earn one ... but he's not irreplaceable. Ohio State won the 2014-15 national championship without him and several games the following year with Cardale Jones as the primary quarterback. Whether that was the correct call to begin with is another story, I just know Ohio State has proven it can win without him. Christian Kirk, WR, Texas A&M: He's been A&M's leading receiver in catches over the past two seasons and he's an electrifying return man. College football has produced some exciting utility players over the past few years and Kirk is the next one. Justin Jackson , RB, Northwestern Wildcats : Jackson is an underrated star. He, not Saquon Barkley, was the Big Ten's leading rusher last season with 1,524 yards. He was also one of the best running backs in the country last season in getting yards after contact . In fact, about 70 percent of his total yardage came after first contact. That says something about the offensive line he's played behind. It says even more about his ability to make plays when they don't appear to be there. Jalen Hurts , QB, Alabama: This was the toughest cut. The Crimson Tide finally arrived in the 21st century by starting a true dual-threat quarterback last year -- a true freshman, at that -- and it paid off in a big way. Hurts, with Lane Kiffin's help at offensive coordinator, transformed Alabama's offense into a fast, new machine that had been held in R&D for too long. Hurts regressed at the end of last season, so his development remains an ongoing factor. There's also the hype surrounding Hurts' backup, early-enrollee phenom Tua Tagovailoa. There's no quarterback controversy yet, and there shouldn't be until Hurts gives Alabama a reason to have one, but it's a storyline for the back pocket.

21," Association football - Wikipedia Association football From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation , search ""Soccer"" redirects here. For other uses, see Soccer (disambiguation) . This article is about the sport of association football. For other codes of football, see Football . Association football The attacking player (No. 10) attempts to kick the ball beyond the opposing team's goalkeeper, between the goalposts, and beneath the crossbar to score a goal . Highest governing body FIFA Nicknames Football, soccer, the Beautiful Game , the World Game [1] First played 19 December 1863, Limes Field, Mortlake , London , England, United Kingdom [2] Characteristics Contact Permitted ( Limited ) Team members 11 per side (including goalkeeper) Mixed gender Yes, separate competitions Type Team sport , ball sport Equipment Football (or soccer ball) Venue Football pitch (also known as football field, football ground, soccer field, soccer pitch or simply ""pitch"") Presence Country or region Worldwide Olympic Yes, men's since the 1900 Olympics and women's since the 1996 Olympics Paralympic Yes, 5-a-side since 2004 and 7-a-side since 1984 Association football , more commonly known as football or soccer , [3] is a team sport played between two teams of eleven players with a spherical ball . It is played by 250 million players in over 200 countries and dependencies making it the world's most popular sport. [4] [5] [6] [7] The game is played on a rectangular field with a goal at each end. The object of the game is to score by getting the ball into the opposing goal. Players are not allowed to touch the ball with their hands or arms while it is in play, unless they are goalkeepers (and then only when within their penalty area ). Other players mainly use their feet to strike or pass the ball, but may also use their head or torso. The team that scores the most goals by the end of the match wins. If the score is level at the end of the game, either a draw is declared or the game goes into extra time or a penalty shootout depending on the format of the competition. The Laws of the Game were originally codified in England by The Football Association in 1863. Association football is governed internationally by the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA; French : Fédération Internationale de Football Association ), which organises World Cups for both men and women every four years.

The first written ""reference to the inflated ball used in the game"" was in the mid-14th century: ""Þe heued fro þe body went, Als it were a foteballe"". [9] The Online Etymology Dictionary states that the word ""soccer"" was ""split off in 1863"". [9] According to Partha Mazumdar, the term soccer originated in England, first appearing in the 1880s as an Oxford ""-er"" abbreviation of the word ""association"". [10] Within the English-speaking world , association football is now usually called football in the United Kingdom and mainly soccer in Canada and the United States. People in Australia, Ireland, South Africa and New Zealand use either or both terms, although national associations in Australia and New Zealand now primarily use ""football"" for the formal name. [11] History Main article: History of association football Children playing cuju in Song dynasty China. An episkyros player on an ancient stone carving at the National Archaeological Museum, Athens. [12] According to FIFA , the Chinese competitive game cuju (??, literally ""kick ball"") is the earliest form of football for which there is scientific evidence. [13] Cuju players could use any part of the body apart from hands and the intent was kicking a ball through an opening into a net. It was remarkably similar to modern football, though similarities to rugby occurred. [14] [15] During the Han Dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD), cuju games were standardised and rules were established. [14] Phaininda and episkyros were Greek ball games. [16] [17] An image of an episkyros player depicted in low relief on a vase at the National Archaeological Museum of Athens [12] appears on the UEFA European Championship Cup. [18] Athenaeus , writing in 228 AD, referenced the Roman ball game harpastum . Phaininda , episkyros and harpastum were played involving hands and violence. They all appear to have resembled rugby football , wrestling and volleyball more than what is recognizable as modern football. [14] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] As with pre-codified "" mob football "", the antecedent of all modern football codes , these three games involved more handling the ball than kicking. [24] [25] Non-competitive games included kemari in Japan, chuk-guk in Korea and woggabaliri in Australia. Association football in itself does not have a classical history. [26] Notwithstanding any similarities to other ball games played around the world FIFA has recognised that no historical connection exists with any game played in antiquity outside Europe. [27] The modern rules of association football are based on the mid-19th century efforts to standardise the widely varying forms of football played in the public schools of England. The history of football in England dates back to at least the eighth century AD . [28] The Cambridge Rules , first drawn up at Cambridge University in 1848, were particularly influential in the development of subsequent codes, including association football. The Cambridge Rules were written at Trinity College, Cambridge , at a meeting attended by representatives from Eton , Harrow , Rugby , Winchester and Shrewsbury schools. They were not universally adopted. During the 1850s, many clubs unconnected to schools or universities were formed throughout the English-speaking world, to play various forms of football. Some came up with their own distinct codes of rules, most notably the Sheffield Football Club , formed by former public school pupils in 1857, [29] which led to formation of a Sheffield FA in 1867. In 1862, John Charles Thring of Uppingham School also devised an influential set of rules. [30] These ongoing efforts contributed to the formation of The Football Association (The FA) in 1863, which first met on the morning of 26 October 1863 at the Freemasons' Tavern in Great Queen Street , London. [31] The only school to be represented on this occasion was Charterhouse . The Freemason's Tavern was the setting for five more meetings between October and December, which eventually produced the first comprehensive set of rules. At the final meeting, the first FA treasurer, the representative from Blackheath , withdrew his club from the FA over the removal of two draft rules at the previous meeting: the first allowed for running with the ball in hand; the second for obstructing such a run by hacking (kicking an opponent in the shins), tripping and holding. Other English rugby clubs followed this lead and did not join the FA and instead in 1871 formed the Rugby Football Union . The eleven remaining clubs, under the charge of Ebenezer Cobb Morley , went on to ratify the original thirteen laws of the game. [31] These rules included handling of the ball by ""marks"" and the lack of a crossbar, rules which made it remarkably similar to Victorian rules football being developed at that time in Australia. The Sheffield FA played by its own rules until the 1870s with the FA absorbing some of its rules until there was little difference between the games. [32] The world's oldest football competition is the FA Cup , which was founded by C. W. Alcock and has been contested by English teams since 1872. The first official international football match also took place in 1872, between Scotland and England in Glasgow , again at the instigation of C. W. Alcock. England is also home to the world's first football league , which was founded in Birmingham in 1888 by Aston Villa director William McGregor . [33] The original format contained 12 clubs from the Midlands and Northern England . The Aston Villa team in 1897, after winning both the FA Cup and the Football League . The laws of the game are determined by the International Football Association Board (IFAB). [34] The board was formed in 1886 [35] after a meeting in Manchester of The Football Association, the Scottish Football Association , the Football Association of Wales , and the Irish Football Association . FIFA , the international football body, was formed in Paris in 1904 and declared that they would adhere to Laws of the Game of the Football Association. [36] The growing popularity of the international game led to the admittance of FIFA representatives to the International Football Association Board in 1913. The board consists of four representatives from FIFA and one representative from each of the four British associations. [37] Today, football is played at a professional level all over the world. Millions of people regularly go to football stadiums to follow their favourite teams, [38] while billions more watch the game on television or on the internet. [39] [40] A very large number of people also play football at an amateur level. According to a survey conducted by FIFA published in 2001, over 240 million people from more than 200 countries regularly play football. [41] Football has the highest global television audience in sport. [42] In many parts of the world football evokes great passions and plays an important role in the life of individual fans , local communities, and even nations. R. Kapuscinski says that Europeans who are polite, modest, or humble fall easily into rage when playing or watching football games. [43] The Côte d'Ivoire national football team helped secure a truce to the nation's civil war in 2006 [44] and it helped further reduce tensions between government and rebel forces in 2007 by playing a match in the rebel capital of Bouaké , an occasion that brought both armies together peacefully for the first time. [45] By contrast, football is widely considered to have been the final proximate cause for the Football War in June 1969 between El Salvador and Honduras. [46] The sport also exacerbated tensions at the beginning of the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s, when a match between Dinamo Zagreb and Red Star Belgrade degenerated into rioting in May 1990. [47] Women's association football Main article: Women's association football A women's international match between the United States and Germany Early women's football Women may have been playing ""football"" for as long as the game has existed. Evidence shows that an ancient version of the game ( Tsu Chu ) was played by women during the Han Dynasty (25–220 CE). Two female figures are depicted in Han Dynasty (25–220 CE) frescoes, playing Tsu Chu. [48] There are, however, a number of opinions about the accuracy of dates, the earliest estimates at 5000 BCE. [49] Association football, the modern game, also has documented early involvement of women. An annual competition in Mid-Lothian, Scotland during the 1790s is reported, too. [50] [51] In 1863, football governing bodies introduced standardised rules to prohibit violence on the pitch, making it more socially acceptable for women to play. [52] The first match recorded by the Scottish Football Association took place in 1892 in Glasgow . In England, the first recorded game of football between women took place in 1895. [52] [53] The most well-documented early European team was founded by activist Nettie Honeyball in England in 1894. It was named the British Ladies' Football Club . Nettie Honeyball is quoted, ""I founded the association late last year [1894], with the fixed resolve of proving to the world that women are not the 'ornamental and useless' creatures men have pictured. I must confess, my convictions on all matters where the sexes are so widely divided are all on the side of emancipation , and I look forward to the time when ladies may sit in Parliament and have a voice in the direction of affairs, especially those which concern them most."" [54] Honeyball and those like her paved the way for women's football. However the women's game was frowned upon by the British football associations, and continued without their support. It has been suggested that this was motivated by a perceived threat to the 'masculinity' of the game. [55] A Welsh women's football team pose for a photograph in 1959 Women's football became popular on a large scale at the time of the First World War , when employment in heavy industry spurred the growth of the game, much as it had done for men fifty years earlier. The most successful team of the era was Dick, Kerr's Ladies of Preston, England . The team played in the first women's international matches in 1920, against a team from Paris , France, in April, and also made up most of the England team against a Scottish Ladies XI in 1920, and winning 22-0. [50] Despite being more popular than some men's football events (one match saw a 53,000 strong crowd), [56] women's football in England suffered a blow in 1921 when The Football Association outlawed the playing of the game on Association members' pitches, on the grounds that the game (as played by women) was distasteful. [57] Some speculated that this may have also been due to envy of the large crowds that women's matches attracted. [58] This led to the formation of the English Ladies Football Association and play moved to rugby grounds. [59] Association football has been played by women since at least the time of the first recorded women's games in the late 19th century. [60] [61] It has traditionally been associated with charity games and physical exercise, particularly in the United Kingdom. [61] In the late 1960s and early 1970s women's association football was organised in the United Kingdom, eventually becoming the most prominent team sport for British women. [61] 20th and 21st century The growth in women's football has seen major competitions being launched at both national and international level mirroring the male competitions. Women's football has faced many struggles. It had a ""golden age"" in the United Kingdom in the early 1920s when crowds reached 50,000 at some matches; [62] this was stopped on 5 December 1921 when England's Football Association voted to ban the game from grounds used by its member clubs. The FA's ban was rescinded in December 1969 with UEFA voting to officially recognise women's football in 1971. [61] The FIFA Women's World Cup was inaugurated in 1991 and has been held every four years since, [63] while women's football has been an Olympic event since 1996 . Gameplay A goalkeeper saving a close-range shot from inside the penalty area Association football is played in accordance with a set of rules known as the Laws of the Game . The game is played using a spherical ball of 68–70 cm (27–28 in) circumference, [64] known as the football (or soccer ball ). Two teams of eleven players each compete to get the ball into the other team's goal (between the posts and under the bar), thereby scoring a goal. The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner; if both teams have scored an equal number of goals then the game is a draw. Each team is led by a captain who has only one official responsibility as mandated by the Laws of the Game: to represent his or her team in the coin toss prior to kick-off or penalty kicks . [65] The primary law is that players other than goalkeepers may not deliberately handle the ball with their hands or arms during play, though they must use both their hands during a throw-in restart. Although players usually use their feet to move the ball around they may use any part of their body (notably, ""heading"" with the forehead) [66] other than their hands or arms. [67] Within normal play, all players are free to play the ball in any direction and move throughout the pitch, though the ball cannot be received in an offside position. [68] A player executing a slide tackle to dispossess an opponent During gameplay, players attempt to create goal-scoring opportunities through individual control of the ball, such as by dribbling , passing the ball to a teammate, and by taking shots at the goal, which is guarded by the opposing goalkeeper. Opposing players may try to regain control of the ball by intercepting a pass or through tackling the opponent in possession of the ball; however, physical contact between opponents is restricted. Football is generally a free-flowing game, with play stopping only when the ball has left the field of play or when play is stopped by the referee for an infringement of the rules. After a stoppage, play recommences with a specified restart. [69] At a professional level, most matches produce only a few goals. For example, the 2005–06 season of the English Premier League produced an average of 2.48 goals per match. [70] The Laws of the Game do not specify any player positions other than goalkeeper, [71] but a number of specialised roles have evolved. Broadly, these include three main categories: strikers , or forwards, whose main task is to score goals; defenders , who specialise in preventing their opponents from scoring; and midfielders , who dispossess the opposition and keep possession of the ball to pass it to the forwards on their team. Players in these positions are referred to as outfield players, to distinguish them from the goalkeeper. These positions are further subdivided according to the area of the field in which the player spends most time. For example, there are central defenders, and left and right midfielders. The ten outfield players may be arranged in any combination. The number of players in each position determines the style of the team's play; more forwards and fewer defenders creates a more aggressive and offensive-minded game, while the reverse creates a slower, more defensive style of play. While players typically spend most of the game in a specific position, there are few restrictions on player movement, and players can switch positions at any time. [72] The layout of a team's players is known as a formation . Defining the team's formation and tactics is usually the prerogative of the team's manager . [73] Laws ""Rules of football"" redirects here. For the rules of other football games, see Football . Main article: Laws of the Game (association football) There are 17 laws in the official Laws of the Game, each containing a collection of stipulation and guidelines. The same laws are designed to apply to all levels of football, although certain modifications for groups such as juniors, seniors, women and people with physical disabilities are permitted. The laws are often framed in broad terms, which allow flexibility in their application depending on the nature of the game. The Laws of the Game are published by FIFA, but are maintained by the International Football Association Board (IFAB). [74] In addition to the seventeen laws, numerous IFAB decisions and other directives contribute to the regulation of football. Players, equipment, and officials See also: Association football positions , Formation (association football) , and Kit (association football) The referee officiates in a football match Each team consists of a maximum of eleven players (excluding substitutes ), one of whom must be the goalkeeper . Competition rules may state a minimum number of players required to constitute a team, which is usually seven. Goalkeepers are the only players allowed to play the ball with their hands or arms, provided they do so within the penalty area in front of their own goal. Though there are a variety of positions in which the outfield (non-goalkeeper) players are strategically placed by a coach, these positions are not defined or required by the Laws. [71] The basic equipment or kit players are required to wear includes a shirt, shorts, socks, footwear and adequate shin guards . An athletic supporter and protective cup is highly recommended for male players by medical experts and professionals. [75] [76] Headgear is not a required piece of basic equipment, but players today may choose to wear it to protect themselves from head injury. Players are forbidden to wear or use anything that is dangerous to themselves or another player, such as jewellery or watches. The goalkeeper must wear clothing that is easily distinguishable from that worn by the other players and the match officials. [77] A number of players may be replaced by substitutes during the course of the game. The maximum number of substitutions permitted in most competitive international and domestic league games is three, though the permitted number may vary in other competitions or in friendly matches . Common reasons for a substitution include injury, tiredness, ineffectiveness, a tactical switch, or timewasting at the end of a finely poised game. In standard adult matches, a player who has been substituted may not take further part in a match. [78] IFAB recommends ""that a match should not continue if there are fewer than seven players in either team."" Any decision regarding points awarded for abandoned games is left to the individual football associations. [79] A game is officiated by a referee , who has ""full authority to enforce the Laws of the Game in connection with the match to which he has been appointed"" (Law 5), and whose decisions are final. The referee is assisted by two assistant referees . In many high-level games there is also a fourth official who assists the referee and may replace another official should the need arise. [80] Ball Main article: Ball (association football) The ball is spherical with a circumference of between 68 and 70 centimetres (27 and 28 in), a weight in the range of 410 to 450 grams (14 to 16 oz), and a pressure between 0.6 and 1.1 bars (8.5 and 15.6 pounds per square inch ) at sea level. In the past the ball was made up of leather panels sewn together, with a latex bladder for pressurisation but modern balls at all levels of the game are now synthetic. [81] [82] Pitch Main article: Football pitch Standard pitch measurements ( See Imperial version ) As the Laws were formulated in England, and were initially administered solely by the four British football associations within IFAB , the standard dimensions of a football pitch were originally expressed in imperial units . The Laws now express dimensions with approximate metric equivalents (followed by traditional units in brackets), though use of imperial units remains popular in English-speaking countries with a relatively recent history of metrication (or only partial metrication), such as Britain. [83] The length of the pitch, or field, for international adult matches is in the range of 100–110 m (110–120 yd) and the width is in the range of 64–75 m (70–80 yd). Fields for non-international matches may be 90–120 m (100–130 yd) length and 45–90 m (50–100 yd) in width, provided that the pitch does not become square. In 2008, the IFAB initially approved a fixed size of 105 m (344 ft) long and 68 m (223 ft) wide as a standard pitch dimension for international matches; [84] however, this decision was later put on hold and was never actually implemented. [85] The longer boundary lines are touchlines , while the shorter boundaries (on which the goals are placed) are goal lines . A rectangular goal is positioned at the middle of each goal line. [86] The inner edges of the vertical goal posts must be 24 feet (7.3 m) apart, and the lower edge of the horizontal crossbar supported by the goal posts must be 8 feet (2.4 m) above the ground. Nets are usually placed behind the goal, but are not required by the Laws. [87] In front of the goal is the penalty area. This area is marked by the goal line, two lines starting on the goal line 16.5 m (18 yd) from the goalposts and extending 16.5 m (18 yd) into the pitch perpendicular to the goal line, and a line joining them. This area has a number of functions, the most prominent being to mark where the goalkeeper may handle the ball and where a penalty foul by a member of the defending team becomes punishable by a penalty kick. Other markings define the position of the ball or players at kick-offs , goal kicks, penalty kicks and corner kicks. [88] Duration and tie-breaking methods A standard adult football match consists of two periods of 45 minutes each, known as halves. Each half runs continuously, meaning that the clock is not stopped when the ball is out of play. There is usually a 15-minute half-time break between halves. The end of the match is known as full-time. [89] The referee is the official timekeeper for the match, and may make an allowance for time lost through substitutions, injured players requiring attention, or other stoppages. This added time is called additional time in FIFA documents, [90] [91] but is most commonly referred to as stoppage time or injury time , while loss time can also be used as a synonym. The duration of stoppage time is at the sole discretion of the referee. The referee alone signals the end of the match. In matches where a fourth official is appointed, towards the end of the half the referee signals how many minutes of stoppage time he intends to add. The fourth official then informs the players and spectators by holding up a board showing this number. The signalled stoppage time may be further extended by the referee. [89] Added time was introduced because of an incident which happened in 1891 during a match between Stoke and Aston Villa . Trailing 1–0 and with just two minutes remaining, Stoke were awarded a penalty. Villa's goalkeeper kicked the ball out of the ground, and by the time the ball had been recovered, the 90 minutes had elapsed and the game was over. [92] The same law also states that the duration of either half is extended until the penalty kick to be taken or retaken is completed, thus no game shall end with a penalty to be taken. [93] Some football competitions use a penalty shootout to decide the winner if a match ends as a draw In league competitions, games may end in a draw. In knockout competitions where a winner is required various methods may be employed to break such a deadlock, some competitions may invoke replays . [94] A game tied at the end of regulation time may go into extra time, which consists of two further 15-minute periods. If the score is still tied after extra time, some competitions allow the use of penalty shootouts (known officially in the Laws of the Game as ""kicks from the penalty mark"") to determine which team will progress to the next stage of the tournament. Goals scored during extra time periods count towards the final score of the game, but kicks from the penalty mark are only used to decide the team that progresses to the next part of the tournament (with goals scored in a penalty shootout not making up part of the final score). [65] In competitions using two-legged matches , each team competes at home once, with an aggregate score from the two matches deciding which team progresses. Where aggregates are equal, the away goals rule may be used to determine the winners, in which case the winner is the team that scored the most goals in the leg they played away from home. If the result is still equal, extra time and potentially a penalty shootout are required. [65] In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the IFAB experimented with ways of creating a winner without requiring a penalty shootout, which was often seen as an undesirable way to end a match. These involved rules ending a game in extra time early, either when the first goal in extra time was scored ( golden goal ), or if one team held a lead at the end of the first period of extra time ( silver goal ). Golden goal was used at the World Cup in 1998 and 2002 . The first World Cup game decided by a golden goal was France 's victory over Paraguay in 1998. Germany was the first nation to score a golden goal in a major competition, beating Czech Republic in the final of Euro 1996 . Silver goal was used in Euro 2004 . Both these experiments have been discontinued by IFAB. [95] Ball in and out of play Main article: Ball in and out of play Under the Laws, the two basic states of play during a game are ball in play and ball out of play . From the beginning of each playing period with a kick-off until the end of the playing period, the ball is in play at all times, except when either the ball leaves the field of play, or play is stopped by the referee. When the ball becomes out of play, play is restarted by one of eight restart methods depending on how it went out of play: A player takes a free kick, while the opposition form a ""wall"" to try to block the ball Kick-off : following a goal by the opposing team, or to begin each period of play. [69] Throw-in : when the ball has crossed the touchline; awarded to the opposing team to that which last touched the ball. [96] Goal kick : when the ball has wholly crossed the goal line without a goal having been scored and having last been touched by a player of the attacking team; awarded to defending team. [97] Corner kick : when the ball has wholly crossed the goal line without a goal having been scored and having last been touched by a player of the defending team; awarded to attacking team. [98] Indirect free kick : awarded to the opposing team following ""non-penal"" fouls, certain technical infringements, or when play is stopped to caution or dismiss an opponent without a specific foul having occurred. A goal may not be scored directly (without the ball first touching another player) from an indirect free kick. [99] Direct free kick : awarded to fouled team following certain listed ""penal"" fouls. [99] A goal may be scored directly from a direct free kick. Penalty kick : awarded to the fouled team following a foul usually punishable by a direct free kick but that has occurred within their opponent's penalty area. [100] Dropped-ball : occurs when the referee has stopped play for any other reason, such as a serious injury to a player, interference by an external party, or a ball becoming defective. [69] Misconduct Main article: Foul (association football) On-field Players are cautioned with a yellow card, and dismissed from the game with a red card. These colours were first introduced at the 1970 FIFA World Cup and used consistently since. A foul occurs when a player commits an offence listed in the Laws of the Game while the ball is in play. The offences that constitute a foul are listed in Law 12. Handling the ball deliberately, tripping an opponent, or pushing an opponent, are examples of ""penal fouls"", punishable by a direct free kick or penalty kick depending on where the offence occurred. Other fouls are punishable by an indirect free kick . [67] The referee may punish a player's or substitute's misconduct by a caution ( yellow card ) or dismissal ( red card ). A second yellow card in the same game leads to a red card, and which results in a dismissal. A player given a yellow card is said to have been ""booked"", the referee writing the player's name in his official notebook. If a player has been dismissed, no substitute can be brought on in their place and the player must leave the field. Misconduct may occur at any time, and while the offences that constitute misconduct are listed, the definitions are broad. In particular, the offence of ""unsporting behaviour"" may be used to deal with most events that violate the spirit of the game, even if they are not listed as specific offences. A referee can show a yellow or red card to a player, substitute or substituted player. Non-players such as managers and support staff cannot be shown the yellow or red card, but may be expelled from the technical area if they fail to conduct themselves in a responsible manner. [67] Rather than stopping play, the referee may allow play to continue if doing so will benefit the team against which an offence has been committed. This is known as ""playing an advantage"". [101] The referee may ""call back"" play and penalise the original offence if the anticipated advantage does not ensue within ""a few seconds"". Even if an offence is not penalised due to advantage being played, the offender may still be sanctioned for misconduct at the next stoppage of play. [102] The referee's decision in all on-pitch matters is considered final. [103] The score of a match cannot be altered after the game, even if later evidence shows that decisions (including awards/non-awards of goals) were incorrect. Off-field See also: Foul (association football) § Post-match Along with the general administration of the sport, football associations and competition organisers also enforce good conduct in wider aspects of the game, dealing with issues such as comments to the press, clubs' financial management, doping , age fraud and match fixing . Most competitions enforce mandatory suspensions for players who are sent off in a game. [104] Some on-field incidents, if considered very serious (such as allegations of racial abuse), may result in competitions deciding to impose heavier sanctions than those normally associated with a red card. [105] Some associations allow for appeals against player suspensions incurred on-field if clubs feel a referee was incorrect or unduly harsh. [104] Sanctions for such infractions may be levied on individuals or on to clubs as a whole. Penalties may include fines, points deductions (in league competitions) or even expulsion from competitions. For example, the English and Scottish leagues will often deduct 10 points from a team that enters financial administration . Among other administrative sanctions are penalties against game forfeiture. Teams that had forfeited a game or had been forfeited against would be awarded a technical loss or win. Governing bodies See also: Association football around the world Headquarters of FIFA , the world governing body of football The recognised international governing body of football (and associated games, such as futsal and beach soccer ) is FIFA . The FIFA headquarters are located in Zürich , Switzerland. Six regional confederations are associated with FIFA; these are: [106] Asia: Asian Football Confederation (AFC) Africa: Confederation of African Football (CAF) Europe: Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) North/Central America & Caribbean: Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF) Oceania: Oceania Football Confederation (OFC) South America: Confederación Sudamericana de Fútbol/Confederação Sul-americana de Futebol (South American Football Confederation; CONMEBOL) National associations oversee football within individual countries. These are generally synonymous with sovereign states, (for example: the Fédération Camerounaise de Football in Cameroon) but also include a smaller number of associations responsible for sub-national entities or autonomous regions (for example the Scottish Football Association in Scotland). 209 national associations are affiliated both with FIFA and with their respective continental confederations. [106] While FIFA is responsible for arranging competitions and most rules related to international competition, the actual Laws of the Game are set by the International Football Association Board , where each of the UK Associations has one vote, while FIFA collectively has four votes. [37] International competitions Main article: List of association football competitions A minute of silence before an international match The major international competition in football is the World Cup , organised by FIFA. This competition takes place every four years. Approximately 190–200 national teams compete in qualifying tournaments within the scope of continental confederations for a place in the finals. The finals tournament, which is held every four years, involves 32 national teams competing over a four-week period. [107] The most recent edition of the tournament was the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil. There has been a football tournament at every Summer Olympic Games since 1900, except at the 1932 games in Los Angeles . [108] Before the inception of the World Cup, the Olympics (especially during the 1920s) had the same status as the World Cup. Originally, the event was for amateurs only; [36] however, since the 1984 Summer Olympics , professional players have been permitted, albeit with certain restrictions which prevent countries from fielding their strongest sides. The Olympic men's tournament is played at Under-23 level. In the past the Olympics have allowed a restricted number of over-age players per team. [109] A women's tournament was added in 1996; in contrast to the men's event, full international sides without age restrictions play the women's Olympic tournament. [110] Spanish footballers celebrating winning the UEFA European Championship After the World Cup, the most important international football competitions are the continental championships, which are organised by each continental confederation and contested between national teams. These are the European Championship (UEFA), the Copa América (CONMEBOL), African Cup of Nations (CAF), the Asian Cup (AFC), the CONCACAF Gold Cup (CONCACAF) and the OFC Nations Cup (OFC). The FIFA Confederations Cup is contested by the winners of all six continental championships, the current FIFA World Cup champions and the country which is hosting the Confederations Cup. This is generally regarded as a warm-up tournament for the upcoming FIFA World Cup and does not carry the same prestige as the World Cup itself. The most prestigious competitions in club football are the respective continental championships, which are generally contested between national champions, for example the UEFA Champions League in Europe and the Copa Libertadores in South America. The winners of each continental competition contest the FIFA Club World Cup . [111] Domestic competitions Main article: Association football around the world A match in the men's top football league of Germany The governing bodies in each country operate league systems in a domestic season , normally comprising several divisions , in which the teams gain points throughout the season depending on results. Teams are placed into tables , placing them in order according to points accrued. Most commonly, each team plays every other team in its league at home and away in each season, in a round-robin tournament . At the end of a season, the top team is declared the champion. The top few teams may be promoted to a higher division, and one or more of the teams finishing at the bottom are relegated to a lower division. [112] The teams finishing at the top of a country's league may be eligible also to play in international club competitions in the following season. The main exceptions to this system occur in some Latin American leagues, which divide football championships into two sections named Apertura and Clausura (Spanish for Opening and Closing ), awarding a champion for each. [113] The majority of countries supplement the league system with one or more ""cup"" competitions organised on a knock-out basis. Some countries' top divisions feature highly paid star players; in smaller countries and lower divisions, players may be part-timers with a second job, or amateurs. The five top European leagues – the Bundesliga (Germany), Premier League (England), [114] La Liga (Spain), Serie A (Italy), and Ligue 1 (France) – attract most of the world's best players and each of the leagues has a total wage cost in excess of £600 million/€763 million/US$1.185 billion. [115] Variants and casual play See also: Variants of association football and Street football Play media To many, football is more than just a sport: a video short on the many styles and ethnicities who play football. Variants of football have been codified for reduced-sized teams (i.e. five-a-side football ) play in non-field environments (i.e. beach soccer , indoor soccer , and futsal ) and for teams with disabilities (i.e. paralympic association football ). Casual games can be played with only minimal equipment – a basic game can be played on almost any open area of reasonable size with just a ball and items to mark the positions of two sets of goalposts. Such games can have team sizes that vary from eleven-a-side, can use a limited or modified subset of the official rules, and can be self-officiated by the players.

British Universities & Colleges Sport (BUCS) is the governing body for sport in the UK at university level. Football is its largest programme with more than 450 men’s and 150 women’s teams taking part. In the UK, BUCS’s main competition is its annual Championships. In addition to the universities listed below, Stirling, Loughborough and Nottingham Trent have made it into the quarter-finals and semis over the past few years. BUCS also has a Trophy competition in which the men’s first teams for Manchester Metropolitan, Essex and Gloucestershire have all excelled, with Leeds and St Mary’s first teams doing similarly well for women’s football. On the international stage, BUCS enters men’s and women’s teams into the World University Summer Games and European University competitions. Recently, its sports programmes have included futsal competitions. Futsal is a version of five-a-side football played on a smaller pitch and most often indoors. Cardiff Metropolitan University Cardiff Metropolitan has seven Cardiff-based football teams taking part in BUCS competitions, plus a football team for computing and business studies undergraduates at its London School of Commerce which plays in BUCS’s London league.

Explore Content Download the report View the infographic View the slideshare View previous reports Key contacts Social media commentary Published just eight months after the end of the 2015/16 season, the Money League is the most contemporary and reliable analysis of the clubs’ relative financial performance. Aggregate revenue for the top 20 Money League clubs rose 12% to €7.4 billion (£5.5 billion) in 2015/16, a new record, with three clubs breaking the €600m barrier. Manchester United replace Real Madrid at Money League summit Manchester United regained first place in the Money League 2017, breaking the 11-year hold that Real Madrid had on top spot. Record revenue of €689m (£515.3m) reflected strong growth across all three revenue categories (matchday, broadcast and commercial), boosted by the club’s return to the UEFA Champions League and new commercial partnerships. FC Barcelona (€620.2m) and Real Madrid (€620.1m) complete the Money League top three, as they did in the first edition of the Money League, produced for the 1996/97 season. Leicester City reap financial reward after historic championship season To cap a remarkable year, Leicester City take their place as the 20th highest revenue-generating club in world football. Boosted by their title-winning campaign, their 2015/16 revenue of €172.1m (£128.7m) is almost five times as much as the amount they generated two years previously in the 2013/14 season. With Premier League clubs set to benefit from increased revenue due to their record television contracts in 2016/17, there is a strong chance that almost all Premier League clubs will be in the top 30 clubs next year. 2017 infographic To mark the 20th edition of the Money League, our infographic profiles the evolution of the Money League since it was first published in 1997.

33," The Beautiful Game - Wikipedia The Beautiful Game From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation , search For other uses, see The Beautiful Game (disambiguation) . The Beautiful Game ( Portuguese : o jogo bonito ) is a nickname for association football popularised by the Brazilian professional footballer Pelé . Although the exact origin of the phrase is disputed, football commentator Stuart Hall used it in 1958. Hall admired Peter Doherty when he went to see Manchester City play at Maine Road and used the term ""The Beautiful Game"" to describe Doherty's style when playing. [1] Contents 1 Etymology 2 Usage 3 Terms used 4 See also 5 References Etymology [ edit ] The exact origins of the term are disputed. The origin has been attributed to Brazilian footballer Waldyr Pereira (Didi) , [2] and the presenter Stuart Hall claimed to have originated it in 1958. [2] [3] The English author and football fanatic H. E. Bates used the term earlier, including in a 1952 newspaper piece extolling the virtues of the game entitled ""Brains in the Feet"". [4] Earlier writers used the term in 1848 to describe the game of baaga'adowe , a forerunner of lacrosse as played by Ojibwe at Vauxhall Gardens in London , [5] and to tennis in 1890. [6] Usage [ edit ] Brazilian footballer Pelé is credited with making the phrase synonymous with football. [7] In 1977, he named his autobiography My Life and the Beautiful Game . The book's dedication reads ""I dedicate this book to all the people who have made this great game the Beautiful Game."" [8] The phrase has entered the language as a description for football. It is used as a title for the 13-part 2002 series charting the history of the game: History of Football: The Beautiful Game , narrated by Terence Stamp . [9] In January 2014, New Model Army released a song called The Beautiful Game in support of the project ""Spirit of Football"". [10] A football podcast was released with the title ""The Beautiful Game"". [11] Terms used [ edit ] Sportswear company Nike has referenced the beautiful game in its football commercials. In 1996, a Nike commercial titled ""Good vs Evil"" was a gladiatorial game set in a Roman amphitheatre where ten football players from around the world, including Eric Cantona , Ronaldo , Paolo Maldini , Luís Figo , Patrick Kluivert and Jorge Campos , defend ""the beautiful game"" against a team of demonic warriors, which culminates in Cantona receiving the ball from Ronaldo, pulling up his shirt collar, and delivering the final line, ""Au Revoir"", before striking the ball and destroying evil. [12] Nike also uses the Portuguese phrase Joga bonito —meaning ""play beautifully"", and not ""beautiful game"", which would be Jogo bonito —as one of its slogans for football products. [13] [14] Nike began using the slogan Joga bonito in a campaign preceding the 2006 FIFA World Cup in an attempt to curb players' behaviours on the pitch. In collaboration with, and promoted by, former international footballer Eric Cantona, Nike released a series of adverts to promote a game that is skillful and dignified, not riddled with theatrics and poor sportsmanship. [15] Adidas has also named one out of the two match balls made for the UEFA EURO 2016 Tournament ""Le Beau Jeu"" which translates to ""The Beautiful Game"" in English.

The Great Manchester Run and Great CityGames are both being staged this weekend Athletics on the BBC Friday: Great CityGames Coverage times: 18:00-19:30 BST, BBC Two Sunday: Great Manchester Run Coverage times: 12:00-14:30, BBC Two Highlights: 17:00-1800, BBC Two The Great Manchester Run will go ahead on Sunday following talks over security after the Manchester Arena attack. Europe's largest 10km run had more than 35,000 runners last year and there will also be a half-marathon this time. ""Manchester is a truly resilient city and we look forward to successfully hosting these great sporting events,"" said city councillor Luthfur Rahman. Earlier, Chelsea cancelled their Premier League victory parade, which was due to take place on Sunday. The club say it would be ""inappropriate"" with the UK terror threat at its highest level after Monday's bombing killed 22 people. Thousands expected at Great Run Greater Manchester Police and the city council had already said athletics' Great CityGames could take place in Manchester on Friday evening. Now they have given the go-ahead for the Great Run, with additional security measures expected to be in force. Rahman, the council's executive member for culture and leisure, said: ""The Great CityGames and Great Manchester Run are two of the real highlights of Manchester's sporting calendar. ""We know that thousands of Mancunians have been looking forward to taking part, or cheering the athletes on, so I am pleased and proud to confirm that these fantastic events will be held as planned this weekend."" Olympic long jump champion Greg Rutherford is among those lined up to take part on Friday, with Sunday's field including Ethiopia's triple Olympic champions Kenenisa Bekele and Tirunesh Dibaba. Chelsea call off parade Chelsea players were presented with the Premier League trophy at Stamford Bridge on Sunday Chelsea had planned an open-top bus tour with the trophy and hoped to add the FA Cup in Saturday's final with Arsenal. The Gunners have also said they will not stage a parade should they win. A screening of the match at the club's Emirates Stadium has been cancelled and fans will be given refunds. Sport to conduct security reviews after attack Right for Man Utd final to go ahead - police Toure and agent to donate £100,000 to victims Chelsea said players will make a donation to a fund supporting victims of the attack and they will wear black armbands for the final at Wembley, with a minute's silence beforehand. ""Everyone associated with Chelsea Football Club offers our heartfelt condolences to those affected by Monday's terror attack in Manchester,"" said a club statement. ""Our thoughts go out to all the victims and their families and friends."" Arsenal chief executive Ivan Gazidis said the safety of supporters and staff was paramount and the club had been in close contact with the security services. ""After taking their advice we have reluctantly taken the decision to cancel the screening and potential parade,"" he said. Spectators at all major events can expect to see more armed police and face longer security checks. Media playback is not supported on this device Liverpool pay respect to Manchester victims West Ham owner helps homeless man A rough sleeper who helped victims of the bomb attack is to be given six months' free accommodation by David Sullivan, West Ham United's co-chairman. Sullivan and his eldest son Dave were moved by reports of a man named Steve who tended to children when the bomb went off at a concert being given by American singer Ariana Grande. West Ham's joint owner tracked down the homeless man after putting out an appeal on BBC Radio 5 live while his son took to social media. They are now working out a plan to pay his rent for the next six months, while also providing him with new clothes and opportunities to find work . ""Steve was just one of hundreds of people who forgot about their own safety and rushed to the aid of others, and we were both moved by his story,"" said David Sullivan. The Sullivans appealed for help via the BBC and social media Sport pays tribute after attack A minute's silence was observed before the Europa League final between Manchester United and Ajax in Stockholm on Wednesday and both wore black armbands. The opening ceremony was considerably reduced as a mark of respect for the victims. England and South Africa stood shoulder to shoulder for a minute's silence before the first match of the one-day cricket series at Headingley. Both teams wore black armbands as they took the field in Leeds, with all 15 members of the England squad lining up on the pitch alongside the tourists and umpires for a sombrely observed silence. Players and spectators paid tribute at Headingley Formula 1 is expected to observe a silence before this weekend's Monaco Grand Prix. F1's teams, the majority of which are based in Britain, have also agreed to have #Manchester on their cars. British driver Lewis Hamilton said he would be thinking of the victims. ""I am carrying them in my heart this weekend,"" said Hamilton. ""It is difficult to think about it and it is just crazy to think where we are in the world."" What about other events? Salford are to waive admission prices for their next rugby league match in return for donations to the appeal fund. Fans can obtain free tickets for the Red Devils' Super League match against Catalans Dragons at the AJ Bell Stadium on Friday night but will be asked to make a donation in return. ""Like everybody, I was shocked and outraged by the events of Monday night,"" said Salford owner Dr Marwan Koukash, a Palestinian refugee who became a self-made millionaire after coming to England to study. Supporters attending this weekend's football play-off finals at Wembley are being urged to arrive at least an hour before kick-off. Blackpool take on Exeter City in League Two on Sunday while Huddersfield Town face Reading in Monday's Championship match. Both games start at 15:00 BST. Fans are asked not to bring bags, with extra security in place. A minute's silence will be held before both games, with players and match officials wearing black armbands. Police Scotland will be reviewing its security, including arrangements for Saturday's Scottish Cup final. Premiership Rugby said there will be a minute's silence before Saturday's final between Exeter and Wasps at Twickenham. And in the Women's Super League Manchester City Women's home game against Chelsea Ladies on Thursday night will go ahead after discussions with police.

53," Laws of the Game (association football) - Wikipedia Laws of the Game (association football) From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation , search ""LOTG"" redirects here. For the Nashville concert series, see Live on the Green . For the film, see Legend of the Guardians . The Laws of the Game [1] are the codified rules that help define association football . They are the only rules of association football subscribed to by the sport's governing body FIFA . The laws mention the number of players a team should have, the game length, the size of the field and ball, the type and nature of fouls that referees may penalise, the frequently misinterpreted offside law, and many other laws that define the sport. During a match, it is the task of the referee to interpret and enforce the Laws of the Game. There were various attempts to codify the rules of football in England in the mid-19th century. The extant Laws date back to 1863 where a ruleset was formally adopted by the newly formed Football Association . The original Laws were heavily influenced by the Cambridge rules and their early development saw substantial influence from the Sheffield Rules . Over time the Laws have been amended, and since 1886 they have been maintained by the International Football Association Board . Contents 1 Current Laws of the Game 1.1 Rules 1.2 Presentation and interpretation 1.3 Jurisdiction and change management 2 History 2.1 Pre-1863 2.2 1863 rules 2.3 IFAB created 2.4 FIFA adoption 2.5 Notable amendments 3 Video technology 4 References 5 External links Current Laws of the Game [ edit ] Rules [ edit ] The current Laws of the Game (LOTG) consist of seventeen individual laws, each law containing several rules and directions: [1] Law 1: The Field of Play Law 2: The Ball Law 3: The Players Law 4: The Players' Equipment Law 5: The Referee Law 6: The Other Match Officials Law 7: The Duration of the Match Law 8: The start and restart of play Law 9: Ball in and out of play Law 10: The Method of Scoring Law 11: Offside Law 12: Fouls and Misconduct Law 13: Free kicks ( direct and indirect ) Law 14: The Penalty Kick Law 15: The Throw-in Law 16: The Goal Kick Law 17: The Corner Kick Presentation and interpretation [ edit ] In 1997, a major revision dropped whole paragraphs and clarified many sections to simplify and strengthen the principles. These laws are written in English Common Law style and are meant to be guidelines and goals of principle that are then clarified through practice, tradition, and enforcement by the referees . The actual law book has long contained 50 pages more of material, organized in numerous sections, that contain many diagrams but did not fit with the main 17 laws. In 2007, many of these additional sections along with much of the material from the FIFA Questions and Answers (Q&A), were restructured and put into a new ""Additional Instructions and Guidelines for the Referee"" section. This section is organized under the same 17 law points, consists of concise paragraphs and phrases like the laws themselves, and adds much clarifying material that had been only available from national organizations and word of mouth among referees. The entire 2015/2016 edition is 144 pages. Referees are expected to use their judgement and common sense in applying the laws; this is colloquially known as ""Law 18"". [2] Jurisdiction and change management [ edit ] The laws are administered by the International Football Association Board (IFAB). They meet at least once a year to debate and decide any changes to the text as it exists at that time. The meeting in winter generally leads to an update to the laws on 1 July of each year that take effect immediately. The laws govern all international matches and national matches of member organizations. [3] A minimum of six of the eight seat IFAB board needs to vote to accept a rule change. Four seats are held by FIFA to represent their 200+ member Nations, with the other four going to each of the British associations (the FA representing England, the SFA representing Scotland, FAW representing Wales and the IFA representing Northern Ireland), meaning that no change can be made without FIFA's approval, but FIFA cannot change the Laws without the approval of at least two of the British governing bodies. [3] History [ edit ] See also: History of association football Pre-1863 [ edit ] Games which could be described in the most general sense as 'football' had been popular in Britain since the Medieval period . Rules for these games, where they existed, were neither universal nor codified. A significant step towards unification was the drafting of the Cambridge rules in 1848 – though these were not universally adopted outside Cambridge University. The first and still oldest Football Club was Sheffield FC (founded in 1857), who in 1858 codified the Sheffield rules of football. The Sheffield rules were popular and adopted by several Northern and Midlands clubs. 1863 rules [ edit ] Wikisource has original text related to this article: 1863 Laws of the Game The original hand-written 'Laws of the Game' drafted for and on behalf of The Football Association by Ebenezer Cobb Morley in 1863 on display at the National Football Museum , Manchester. The Laws were first drawn up by Ebenezer Cobb Morley and approved at a meeting of the newly founded Football Association (FA) on 8 December 1863. These rules were heavily based on the Cambridge rules which were codified in 1848. [4] The Football Association Laws of 1863 were published on 5 December in Bell's Life in London for approval. While the game described in the original Football Association Laws is substantially different from the modern game, 1863 is generally considered to be the beginning of modern association football, [5] and the point of divergence of the game from rugby football . Adoption of the laws was not universal among English football clubs. The Sheffield Rules continued to be used by many. Additionally, in preference of a more physical game with greater emphasis on handling of the ball, several decided against being part of the FA in its early years and would later form the Rugby Football Union . At its meeting on 8 December the FA agreed that, as reported in Bell's Life in London , John Lillywhite would publish the Laws. [6] The first game to be played under the new rules was a 0-0 draw between Barnes and Richmond . [6] IFAB created [ edit ] Minor variations between the rules used in England (the jurisdiction of the Football Association) and the other Home Nations of the United Kingdom : Scotland , Wales and Ireland , led to the creation of the International Football Association Board to oversee the rules for all the home nations. Their first meeting was in 1886. [7] Before this, teams from different countries had to agree to which country's rules were used before playing. FIFA adoption [ edit ] When the international football body on the continent FIFA was founded in Paris in 1904, it immediately declared that FIFA would adhere to the rules laid down by the IFAB. The growing popularity of the international game led to the admittance of FIFA representatives to the IFAB in 1913. Up until 1958 it was still possible for the British associations to vote together to impose changes against the wishes of FIFA. This changed with the adoption of the current voting system whereby FIFA's support is necessary, but not sufficient, for any amendment to pass. [3] Notable amendments [ edit ] Notable amendments to the rules include: [8] [5] 1866 – Forward passes are permitted, as long as there are three defending players between the receiver and the goal. This was the first step from a consideration of offside as seen in modern rugby towards the offside rule known in association football today . The fair catch (still seen in other football codes) is eliminated. 1871 – Introduction of the specific position of goalkeeper . 1877 – Full unity with the Sheffield Rules is established – several features of the northern code had been incorporated into the London-based association rulebook over the preceding 14 years. 1891 – The penalty kick is introduced. 1925 – The offside rule is reduced from three to two defending players between the player and the opponent's goal line. 1958 – Introduction of substitutes. 1970 – Introduction of red and yellow cards . 1992 – Introduction of the back-pass rule . 2012 – Goal-line technology permitted (but not required); first used in competition at the 2012 FIFA Club World Cup . [9] Video technology [ edit ] Unlike in several other sports, in association football television replays are not permitted to be part of the match officials' decision-making process. The extent to which game rules and practices should be amended to allow this has been a matter of considerable debate. [10] [11] [12] [13] Live trials of video technology use are planned, beginning in the 2016-17 season or earlier. [14] References [ edit ] ^ a b IFAB (2016). ""Laws of the Game 2016/17"" (PDF) .

He slithers into the area from the right and briefly looks as though he might be about to score one of the great solo goals, but Blind does just enough to squeeze the ball off his toes. Smalling completes the job with a hefty clearance. Traore looks the likeliest player to get Ajax back into this game.

We moved into a house within spitting distance of Maine Road. About a week after we moved we went out on an afternoon drinking session, which went on into the night. At some point I went home, a little worse for wear and got to my front door and tried to put my key in the door. It wouldn’t go in the lock. I tried and tried when all of a sudden the door opened. Rather than my girlfriend standing then, there was a middle aged Mancunian man. “What are you doing in my house” I slurred. He explained it most definitely wasn’t my house but his. I told it wasn’t. Very patiently he said it wasn’t. it was his. But this is 12 XXXXXX Street I assured him? No, its 12 YYYYYYY Street. I had missed my road by three streets. If you have every been round there you can understand why it would be easy to lose you street if you were a bit merry.

Fellaini moves the ball to the unmarked Pogba on the edge of the area and the midfielder’s low left-footer skims off Sanchez and deflects over the helpless Onana. What a waste of money.

And times like this are powerful, terrible, grotesque reminders of that. I’m a Liverpool fan from South Wales with no love for Mourinho, but I hope they win. I hope they bring a trophy back to Manchester. In the grand scheme of things, a tin pot means very, very little. But it will make at least someone start to smile through the tears. And that’s a beautiful thought.” Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.57pm BST 19:57 10 min: Rashford is looking dangerous. His movement across the front is causing problems for Ajax here. He wins a throw on the left. The ball comes to Mata, who swings a menacing ball into the middle.

He slides a pass into the area for Rashford, who turns and sees his shot blocked. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.50pm BST 19:50 2 min: Veltman was down for a moment or two, but he slowly gets back to his feet. He’ll continue. Ajax have started shakily, though, and a foul midway inside their half gives United a free-kick. Blind hangs it towards the right of the Ajax area, where Smalling rises and heads into the middle. Onana confidently claims it.

Manchester United, all in blue, get the Europa League final underway. They are kicking from right to left in the first half and they’re on the attack straight away! The ball’s lifted into the Ajax area by Mata, looking for Mkhitaryan, and that leads to a collision between Onana and Veltman in the Dutch defence. The ball’s cleared as far as Pogba, who controls well before looping a volley just wide from 25 yards. What a start that would have been! Ajax keeper Andre Onana collides with team-mate Joel Veltman.

I also introduced my dad to both of these passions, and watching United games together, as well as watching my “Who Put the ‘M’ in Manchester?” DVD once a year or so, has been a special part of our relationship. I was surprised by how hard the events on Monday hit me, but I think a lot of it came from the affinity I’ve developed for the culture and people of Manchester, even from afar. The people I seeing cheering in the stands every week, and the people who are singing along to the same songs I love, these are people whom I share something with. And to think that we have to be fearful about something as simple as appreciating music, or supporting a football team, is just completely awful. I’ll be nervously following the MBM from work, as I have had to do for most of United’s Europa League run. Win or lose, I just hope they give a great effort, and do the people of Manchester proud tonight.” Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.35pm BST 19:35 “I’ve no connection to Manchester myself, other than an everlasting love for the music of The Fall, but I just thought that I’d throw in Fraiser Crane’s screen father, Martin (John Mahoney),” says Steven Hughes. “He was born in Blackpool, grew up in Manchester, leaving for the U.S. when he was 19.

We come here to do that job the best we can and I think we are ready for it. Not with the same happiness, not with the happiness that we bring with us normally, but from a professional point of view we are ready. I don’t know what Ajax are going to do. I don’t know if they will be able to do what they want to do. We are going to give absolutely everything we have to give. Bailly is suspended. It was a choice between Smalling and Jones. I was pushed to decide Chris because he recovered before Jones and he has one week in advance in relation to Jones. Mata is a position where we have alternatives. We have Martial, we have Lingard. Today it is important to start with experience and a brain and later to go with pace and freshness.

My brother lives there, a lot of my friends are there. I have had some of the best nights out of my life in Manchester. I have wondered around the city centre taking in the noise, the architecture, the accents. Manchester is a melting pot of every religion, race and colour you could think of. Her people are wonderful; they love Manchester and she loves them right back. I worked with people who were in Manchester when the IRA bombed the Arndale in 1996 and they are very matter of face about it – something which I always admired. Manchester and her people are tough bastards and as Tony Wilson correctly said, they do things differently there. They will never forget their fallen and never neglect their wounded, but they will do so with a smile, with love and with the biggest bloody hearts you could hope to find. Again, for what it is worth, come on United, although I’d be lying if I said I was excited for the game.” “First time I ever visited Manchester was for the Germany v Euro 96 match between Germany and Russia at Old Trafford,” says Richard Franks. “Best memory was trying to talk to a load of pissed-up German fans before the game when my mates emerged from the Lou Macari chip shop off Sir Matt Busby Way with trays of chips and mushy peas. When the Germans saw it they all freaked out and called their mates over to check out the weird stuff the locals considered food. They took photos and everything.” “I’m the opposite to you - aside from 3 years in Sheffield for Uni I’ve lived in Manchester all my life,” says John Haslam. “I love this place. I work 200 metres from the Arena and was at work yesterday, not letting these morally bankrupt twunts win. My wife is a police officer and was moved to the City centre to support, and visited the scene during her 15 hour stint. She’s said she’ll never be able to back to the Arena or Victoria station again after seeing what she did. This attack is still an open wound on Town, and it will be a long time before it’s a scar. But we’ll use it to never forget. It’s a gritty city with gritty people, but because of that we’re tough. And we will not let anyone beat us.” “I’m a Liverpool fan – I too lived in Manchester for a year or so, which happened to be 1989,” says Tim Allen. “I also experienced the trauma of the Hillsborough disaster, where I lost a very good friend. Returning to Manchester after that awful weekend, I was shocked to read the Sun’s untruthful version of events on the Monday morning. One of my best mates at that time was a Man United fan, God help him. He and I immediately began laying the groundwork for a boycott of that newspaper in the city – of course other Liverpool fans were organising similar campaigns all around the country. The people of Manchester were outstanding at our time of need – we got overwhelming support from fans of City, United and neither. Their solidarity counted for so much at that difficult time, especially given the rivalry between our cities. I know that the people of our own city will want to stand solidly with the people of Manchester after this disgraceful and cowardly attack.” Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.00pm BST 19:00 That Ajax team. It’s so young. In fact, it’s the youngest ever starting 11 in a major European final. It’s so vibrant and refreshingly positive. Peter Bosz has them set up to charge at their opponents from the first whistle and they have attacking quality on the bench, with Justin Kluivert and David Neres itching to make their mark. Manchester United are unrecognisable from the team that beat Crystal Palace, of course. Jose Mourinho has made it clear that, from his point of view at least, their season rests on this game. Europa League specialist Sergio Romero is in goal instead of David de Gea, Daley Blind and Chris Smalling start in central defence in the absence of the suspended Eric Bailly, Mourinho opts for the physicality of Marouane Fellaini over Michael Carrick in midfield and Marcus Rashford starts up front. Wayne Rooney is on the bench. Will he get on for what could be his final United appearance?

But allow me the indulgence, for a moment, of just saying that I lived in Manchester for three years. They were three of the best years of my life. From that, you’ve probably guessed that it’s where I went to university. I’m a Londoner, but I adore Manchester. Fallowfield, Withington, Didsbury, Fifth Avenue, the Printworks, Deansgate, the Arndale Centre, the football, the Northern Quarter - it all comes flooding back. I was up there recently actually, visiting a friend for his birthday, and was delighted to find that it’s still a wonderful city, that I wasn’t remembering the place through a haze of nostalgia. In fact, I was rather sad when the weekend came to an end. I won’t pretend that what happened is my tragedy, just because I happened to live in a grotty house of seven guys in South Manchester in 2008. But I would like to know what the place means to you. Play Video 1:38 Europa League final overshadowed by Manchester bombing – video report Updated at 7.25pm BST Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.51pm BST 15:51 Preamble Hello. In normal circumstances, in a normal world, where normal people aren’t affected by abnormal events, we would begin our coverage of this major European final between two of the most storied clubs in the world by talking about football. We could talk about how Manchester United’s season hinges on the outcome of one game. Whether Jose Mourinho is getting his mojo back or whether he’s having us on. We could talk about 1968, 1999 and 2008. We could talk about Matt Busby and Sir Alex Ferguson. We could talk about the Class of 92; we could make a link between them and Ajax’s emerging generation of youngsters. We could talk about Peter Bosz. We could talk about 1995. We could talk about Patrick Kluivert. We could talk about Justin Kluivert. We could talk about Johan Cruyff and Total Football. We could talk and talk and talk about something that’s rather irrelevant in the grand scheme of things. But these aren’t normal circumstances. There will be a minute’s silence before kick-off in Stockholm tonight and the players of both sides will wear black armbands, while the mood in the stands will be sombre but defiant. It shouldn’t be this way. We should be talking about football. We should be talking about football . You’d probably like me to start talking about football; maybe drop in some team news or tactical analysis or some thoughts on what missing out on the Champions League would mean for a club of Manchester United’s size. I can’t stop thinking about an Ariana Grande though. It’s strange. I’d never heard of Ariana Grande before waking up on Tuesday morning. Turns out her style of music rather passes people in my demographic by. Chances are, you hadn’t heard of her either - unless, that is, you happen to be the parent of young children. Judging hybrid what I’ve been reading in the past day or so, you’d probably have heard a lot about this singer. And here we are now. Ariana Grande. There is a point when words stop meaning anything at all. But to borrow the phrase from elsewhere, Manchester is a city United, whether you’re red, blue or something else entirely. So don’t ignore the frankly unavoidable and unspeakably tragic subplot that has grimly attached itself to this game of football. But do try to find a way to enjoy it, in your own way, in any way that makes you feel comfortable. That, after all, is why we’re here in the first place. This silly little game, it matters and it doesn’t matter. It should be about Marcus Rashford, the local lad leading the line for his boyhood club, and the youngsters of this wonderfully vibrant Ajax team, who play the kind of football that gives you a warm feeling inside. I know I’m supposed to say that it’s only a game. But then, Ariana Grande’s only a singer. Nights like this matter. Kick-off: 7.45pm BST.

FIFA is responsible for the organization of football's major international tournaments, notably the World Cup which commenced in 1930 and the Women's World Cup which commenced in 1991. FIFA was founded in 1904 to oversee international competition among the national associations of Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland. Headquartered in Zürich , its membership now comprises 211 national associations . Member countries must each also be members of one of the six regional confederations into which the world is divided: Africa , Asia , Europe , North & Central America and the Caribbean , Oceania , and South America . Although FIFA does not control the rules of football (that being the responsibility of the International Football Association Board ), it is responsible for both the organization of a number of tournaments and their promotion, which generate revenue from sponsorship. In 2013, FIFA had revenues of over 1.3 billion U.S. dollars, for a net profit of 72 million, and had cash reserves of over 1.4 billion U.S. dollars. [5] Reports by investigative journalists have linked FIFA leadership with corruption, bribery, and vote-rigging related to the election of FIFA President Sepp Blatter and the organization's decision to award the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar , respectively. These allegations led to the indictments of nine high-ranking FIFA officials and five corporate executives by the U.S. Department of Justice on charges including racketeering , wire fraud , and money laundering . On 27 May 2015, several of these officials were arrested by Swiss authorities, who were launching a simultaneous but separate criminal investigation into how the organization awarded the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. Those among these officials who were also indicted in the U.S. are expected to be extradited to face charges there as well. [6] [7] [8] Many officials were suspended by FIFA's ethics committee including Sepp Blatter [9] and Michel Platini . [10] In early 2017 reports became public about FIFA president Gianni Infantino attempting to prevent the re-elections [11] of both chairmen of the ethics committee, Cornel Borbély and Hans-Joachim Eckert , during the FIFA congress in May 2017. [12] [13] On May 9th, 2017, following Infantino's proposal, [14] FIFA Council decided not to renew the mandates of Borbély and Eckert. [15] Together with the chairmen, eleven of 13 committee members were removed.

The Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) was founded in the rear of the headquarters of the Union des Sociétés Françaises de Sports Athlétiques at the Rue Saint Honoré 229 in Paris on 21 May 1904. [17] The French name and acronym are used even outside French-speaking countries. The founding members were the national associations of Belgium , Denmark , France , the Netherlands , Spain (represented by Madrid Football Club ; the Spanish federation was not created until 1913), Sweden and Switzerland . Also, that same day, the German Association declared its intention of affiliating through a telegram. [1] The first president of FIFA was Robert Guérin . Guérin was replaced in 1906 by Daniel Burley Woolfall from England , by then a member of the association. The first tournament FIFA staged, the association football competition for the 1908 Olympics in London was more successful than its Olympic predecessors, despite the presence of professional footballers, contrary to the founding principles of FIFA. [ dubious – discuss ] Membership of FIFA expanded beyond Europe with the application of South Africa in 1909, Argentina in 1912, Canada and Chile in 1913, and the United States in 1914. [18] During World War I, with many players sent off to war and the possibility of travel for international fixtures severely limited, the organization's survival was in doubt. Post-war, following the death of Woolfall, the organisation was run by Dutchman Carl Hirschmann . It was saved from extinction, but at the cost of the withdrawal of the Home Nations (of the United Kingdom), who cited an unwillingness to participate in international competitions with their recent World War enemies. The Home Nations later resumed their membership. The FIFA collection is held by the National Football Museum at Urbis in Manchester , England. The first World Cup was held in 1930 in Montevideo , Uruguay . Structure [ edit ] Main article: List of FIFA Member Associations Map of the World with the six confederations: membership details below. Laws and governance [ edit ] FIFA is headquartered in Zürich , and is an association established under the Law of Switzerland . FIFA's supreme body is the FIFA Congress , an assembly made up of representatives from each affiliated member association. Each national football association has one vote, regardless of its size or footballing strength. The Congress assembles in ordinary session once every year, and extraordinary sessions have been held once a year since 1998. The congress makes decisions relating to FIFA's governing statutes and their method of implementation and application. Only the Congress can pass changes to FIFA's statutes. The congress approves the annual report, and decides on the acceptance of new national associations and holds elections. Congress elects the President of FIFA , its General Secretary, and the other members of the FIFA Council on the year following the FIFA World Cup . [19] FIFA's Executive Committee, chaired by the President, is the main decision-making body of the organisation in the intervals of Congress. The Executive Committee is composed of 25 people: the President, 8 Vice Presidents, and 15 members and one woman member. The Executive Committee is the body that decides which country will host the World Cup. The President and General Secretary are the main officeholders of FIFA, and are in charge of its daily administration, carried out by the General Secretariat, with its staff of approximately 280 members. Gianni Infantino is the current president, appointed on 26 February 2016 at the Extraordinary FIFA Congress. The former president, Sepp Blatter is suspended pending a corruption investigation . [20] [21] FIFA's worldwide organisational structure also consists of several other bodies, under authority of the Executive Committee or created by Congress as standing committees. Among those bodies are the FIFA Emergency Committee, the FIFA Ethics Committee , the Finance Committee, the Disciplinary Committee, and the Referees Committee. The FIFA Emergency Committee deals with all matters requiring immediate settlement in the time frame between the regular meetings of the FIFA Executive Committee . [22] [23] The Emergency Committee consists of the FIFA President as well as one member from each confederation. [24] Emergency Committee decisions made are immediately put into legal effect, although they need to be ratified at the next Executive Committee meeting. [25] Administrative cost [ edit ] FIFA publishes its results according to IFRS . The total compensation for the management committee in 2011 was 30 million for 35 people. Blatter, the only full-time person on the committee, earned approximately two million Swiss francs, 1.2 million in salary and the rest in bonuses. [26] [27] [28] A report in London's Sunday Times in June 2014 said the members of the committee had their salaries doubled from $100,000 to $200,000 during the year. The report also said leaked documents had indicated $4.4 million in secret bonuses had been paid to the committee members following the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa . [29] Six confederations and 211 national associations [ edit ] FIFA confederations AFC , CAF , CONCACAF CONMEBOL , OFC , UEFA v t e Besides its worldwide institutions there are six confederations recognised by FIFA which oversee the game in the different continents and regions of the world. National associations, and not the continental confederations, are members of FIFA. The continental confederations are provided for in FIFA's statutes, and membership of a confederation is a prerequisite to FIFA membership. Asian Football Confederation (AFC; 46 members) Australia has been a member of the AFC since 2006 Confederation of African Football (CAF; 54 members) Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF; 35 members) French Guiana , Guyana and Suriname are CONCACAF members although they are in South America. The French Guiana team is a member of CONCACAF but not of FIFA. Confederación Sudamericana de Fútbol (CONMEBOL; 10 members) Oceania Football Confederation (OFC; 11 members) Union of European Football Associations (UEFA; 55 members) Teams representing the nations of Armenia , Azerbaijan , Georgia , Israel , Kazakhstan , Russia and Turkey are UEFA members, although the majority or entirety of their territory is outside of continental Europe. Monaco is not member of UEFA or FIFA. In total, FIFA recognises 211 national associations and their associated men's national teams as well as 129 women's national teams; see the list of national football teams and their respective country codes . FIFA has more member states than the UN as FIFA recognises 23 non-sovereign entities as distinct nations, such as the four Home Nations within the United Kingdom and politically disputed territories such as Palestine . [30] The FIFA Working Committee of Small Nations has categorized potential FIFA members into three categories: Independent states not in FIFA ( Kiribati , Marshall Islands , Micronesia , Monaco , Niue , Palau , Tuvalu ) Non-independent territories ( Åland Islands , Guadeloupe , Greenland , Guernsey , Isle of Man , Jersey , Martinique , Northern Mariana Islands , Réunion , Sint Maarten , Zanzibar ) Politically sensitive areas ( Abkhazia , Crimea , Northern Cyprus , South Ossetia ). [31] [32] The FIFA World Rankings are updated monthly and rank each team based on their performance in international competitions, qualifiers, and friendly matches. There is also a world ranking for women's football , updated four times a year. Recognitions and awards [ edit ] FIFA holds an annual awards ceremony which recognises both individual and team achievements in international association football. Individually, the top men's player is awarded the FIFA Ballon d'Or and the top women's player is named FIFA World Player of the Year ; the latter title was also awarded to the men's player prior to its 2010 merger with France Football ' s Ballon d'Or . At the Ballon d'Or banquet, the FIFA Puskás Award , FIFA/FIFPro Best XI , FIFA Fair Play Award , and FIFA Presidential Award are also awarded. In 1994 FIFA published the FIFA World Cup All-Time Team . In 2000 FIFA published the results of an Internet poll, declaring Real Madrid to be the FIFA Club of the Century . In 2002 FIFA announced the FIFA Dream Team , an all-time all-star team chosen by fans in a poll. As part of its centennial celebrations in 2004, FIFA organised a ""Match of the Century"" between France and Brazil . Governance and game development [ edit ] This section needs additional citations for verification . Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (May 2017) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) Main article: Laws of the Game (association football) FIFA headquarters The laws that govern football, known officially as the Laws of the Game , are not solely the responsibility of FIFA; they are maintained by a body called the International Football Association Board (IFAB). FIFA has members on its board (four representatives); the other four are provided by the football associations of the United Kingdom: England , Scotland , Wales , and Northern Ireland , who jointly established IFAB in 1882 and are recognised for the creation and history of the game. Changes to the Laws of the Game must be agreed by at least six of the eight delegates. The FIFA Statutes form the overarching document guiding FIFA's governing system. The governing system is divided into separate bodies that have the appropriate powers to create a system of checks and balances. It consists of four general bodies: the congress, the executive committee, the general secretariat, and standing and ad-hoc committees. [33] Discipline of national associations [ edit ] FIFA frequently takes active roles in the running of the sport and developing the game around the world. One of its sanctions is to suspend teams and associated members from international competition when a government interferes in the running of FIFA's associate member organisations or if the associate is not functioning properly. A 2007 FIFA ruling that a player can be registered with a maximum of three clubs, and appear in official matches for a maximum of two, in a year measured from 1 July to 30 June has led to controversy, especially in those countries whose seasons cross that date barrier, as in the case of two former Ireland internationals . As a direct result of this controversy, FIFA modified this ruling the following year to accommodate transfers between leagues with out-of-phase seasons. Video replay [ edit ] See also: Goal-line technology Flag of FIFA with the organisation's slogan FIFA does not permit video evidence during matches, although it is permitted for subsequent sanctions. [34] The 1970 meeting of the International Football Association Board ""agreed to request the television authorities to refrain from any slow-motion play-back which reflected, or might reflect, adversely on any decision of the referee"". [35] In 2008, FIFA President Sepp Blatter said: ""Let it be as it is and let's leave [football] with errors. The television companies will have the right to say [the referee] was right or wrong, but still the referee makes the decision – a man, not a machine."" [36] It has been said that instant replay is needed given the difficulty of tracking the activities of 22 players on such a large field, [37] and it has been proposed that instant replay be used in penalty incidents, fouls which lead to bookings or red cards and whether the ball has crossed the goal line, since those events are more likely than others to be game-changing. [38] Critics point out that instant replay is already in use in other sports, including rugby union , cricket , American football , Canadian football , basketball , baseball , tennis , and ice hockey . [37] [39] [40] [41] As one notable proponent of video replay, Portuguese coach Carlos Queiroz has been quoted as saying that the ""credibility of the game"" is at stake. [42] An incident during a second-round game in the 2010 FIFA World Cup between England and Germany, where a shot by Englishman Frank Lampard , which would have leveled the scores at 2–2 in a match that ultimately ended in a 4–1 German victory, crossed the line but was not seen to do so by the match officials, led FIFA officials to declare that they will re-examine the use of goal-line technology . [43] Anthem [ edit ] Main article: FIFA Anthem Since the 1994 FIFA World Cup , like the UEFA Champions League , FIFA has adopted an anthem composed by the German composer Franz Lambert . It has been recently re-arranged and produced by Rob May and Simon Hill . The FIFA Anthem is played at the beginning of official FIFA sanctioned matches and tournaments such as international friendlies, the FIFA World Cup , FIFA Women's World Cup , FIFA U-20 World Cup , FIFA U-17 World Cup , Football at the Summer Olympics , FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup , FIFA Women's U-17 World Cup , FIFA Futsal World Cup , FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup and FIFA Club World Cup . [44] Since 2007, FIFA has also required most of its broadcast partners to use short sequences including the anthem at the beginning and end of FIFA event coverage, as well as for break bumpers , to help promote FIFA's sponsors. This emulates practices long used by some other international football events such as the UEFA Champions League. Exceptions may be made for specific events; for example, an original piece of African music was used for bumpers during the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Sponsors [ edit ] Adidas [45] Coca-Cola [46] Gazprom [47] Hyundai/Kia Motors [48] Visa [49] Wanda Group [50] Qatar Airways [51] Corruption and legislative interference [ edit ] Main article: 2015 FIFA corruption case In May 2006 British investigative reporter Andrew Jennings ' book Foul! The Secret World of FIFA: Bribes, Vote-Rigging and Ticket Scandals ( Harper Collins ) caused controversy within the football world by detailing an alleged international cash-for-contracts scandal following the collapse of FIFA's marketing partner International Sport and Leisure (ISL), and revealed how some football officials have been urged to secretly repay the sweeteners they received. The book also alleged that vote-rigging had occurred in the fight for Sepp Blatter's continued control of FIFA. Shortly after the release of Foul! a BBC television exposé by Jennings and BBC producer Roger Corke for the BBC news programme Panorama was broadcast. In this hour-long programme, screened on 11 June 2006, Jennings and the Panorama team agree that Sepp Blatter was being investigated by Swiss police over his role in a secret deal to repay more than £1m worth of bribes pocketed by football officials. Lord Triesman, the former chairman of the English Football Association, described FIFA as an organization that ""behaves like a mafia family"", highlighting the association's ""decades-long traditions of bribes, bungs and corruption"". [52] All testimonies offered in the Panorama exposé were provided through a disguised voice, appearance, or both, save one; Mel Brennan, formerly a lecturer at Towson University in the United States (and from 2001 to 2003 Head of Special Projects for CONCACAF , a liaison to the e-FIFA project and a 2002 FIFA World Cup delegate), became the first high-level football insider to go public with substantial allegations of greed, corruption, nonfeasance and malfeasance by CONCACAF and FIFA leadership. During the Panorama exposé, Brennan—the highest-level African-American in the history of world football governance—joined Jennings, Trinidadian journalist Lisana Liburd and many others in exposing allegedly inappropriate allocations of money at CONCACAF, and drew connections between ostensible CONCACAF criminality and similar behaviours at FIFA. Since then, and in the light of fresh allegations of bribery and corruption and opaque action by FIFA in late 2010, [53] both Jennings and Brennan remain highly critical of FIFA, with Brennan calling directly for an alternative to FIFA to be considered by the stakeholders of the sport throughout the world. [54] In a further Panorama documentary broadcast on BBC One on 29 November 2010, Jennings alleged that three senior FIFA officials, Nicolas Leoz , Issa Hayatou and Ricardo Teixeira , had been paid huge bribes by FIFA's marketing partner ISL between 1989 and 1999, which FIFA had failed to investigate. He claimed they appeared on a list of 175 bribes paid by ISL, totalling about $100 million. A former ISL executive said that there were suspicions within ISL that the company was only awarded the marketing contract for successive World Cups by paying bribes to FIFA officials. The programme also alleged that another current official, Jack Warner , has been repeatedly involved in reselling World Cup tickets to touts; Sepp Blatter said that FIFA had not investigated the allegation because it had not been told about it via 'official channels'. The programme also criticized FIFA for allegedly requiring World Cup host bidding nations to agree to implement special laws for the World Cup, including blanket tax exemption for FIFA and sponsors, and limitation of workers' rights. It alleged that governments of bidding nations are required to keep the details of the required laws confidential during the bidding process; but that they were revealed by the Dutch government , which refused to agree to them, as a result of which it was told by FIFA that its bid could be adversely affected. According to the programme, following Jennings' earlier investigations he was banned from all FIFA press conferences, for reasons he says have not been made clear; and the accused officials failed to answer questions about his latest allegations, either verbally or by letter. British Prime Minister David Cameron and Andy Anson , head of England's World Cup bid, criticized the timing of the broadcast, three days before FIFA's decision on the host for the 2018 FIFA World Cup , on the grounds that it might damage England's bid; the voters included officials accused by the programme. [55] [56] In June 2011, it came to light that the IOC had started inquiry proceedings against FIFA honorary president João Havelange into claims of bribery. The BBC Panorama programme alleged that the Brazilian accepted a $1 million 'bung' in 1997 from ISL. The Olympic governing body said ""the IOC takes all allegations of corruption very seriously and we would always ask for any evidence of wrongdoing involving any IOC members to be passed to our ethics commission"". [57] In a 2014 interview, American sports writer Dave Zirin said greed, corruption, nonfeasance and malfeasance are endemic to FIFA leadership, and that FIFA should be abolished for the good of the game. He said that currently FIFA is in charge of both monitoring corruption in football matches, and marketing and selling the sport, but that two ""separate"" organizational bodies are needed: an organizational body that monitors corruption and match-fixing and the like, and an organization that's responsible for marketing and sponsorships and selling the sport. Zirin said the idea of having a single organization that's responsible for both seems highly ineffective and detrimental to the sport. [58] Guilty pleas [ edit ] Between 2013 and 2015 four individuals, and two sports television rights corporations pleaded guilty to United States financial misconduct charges. The pleas of Chuck Blazer , José Hawilla , Daryan Warner, Darrell Warner, Traffic Group and Traffic Sports USA were unsealed in May 2015. [7] In another 2015 case, Singapore also imposed a 6-year ""harshest sentence ever received for match-fixing"" on match-fixer Eric Ding who had bribed three Lebanese FIFA football officials with prostitutes as an inducement to fix future matches that they would officiate, as well as perverting the course of justice. [59] Indictments and arrests [ edit ] Fourteen FIFA officials and marketing executives were indicted by the United States Department of Justice in May 2015. The officials were arrested in Switzerland and are in the process of extradition to the US. Specific charges (brought under the RICO act) include wire fraud , racketeering , and money laundering . [60] ""Swiss authorities say they have also opened a separate criminal investigation into FIFA's operations pertaining to the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bids"". [61] FIFA’s top officials were arrested at a hotel in Switzerland on suspicion of receiving bribes totalling $100m (£65m). The US Department of Justice stated that nine FIFA officials and four executives of sports management companies were arrested and accused of over $150m in bribes. [62] The UK Shadow Home Secretary and Labour Member of Parliament, Andy Burnham , stated in May 2015 that England should boycott the 2018 World Cup against corruption in FIFA and military aggression by Russia. [63] 2018 and 2022 World Cup bids [ edit ] Further information: 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bids and Garcia Report FIFA's choice to award the 2018 World Cup to Russia and the 2022 World Cup to Qatar has been widely criticised by media. [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] It has been alleged that some FIFA inside sources insist that the Russian kickbacks of cash and gifts given to FIFA executive members were enough to secure the Russian 2018 bid weeks before the result was announced. [69] Sepp Blatter was widely criticised in the media for giving a warning about the ""evils of the media"" in a speech to FIFA executive committee members shortly before they voted on the hosting of the 2018 World Cup, a reference to The Sunday Times exposés [70] and the Panorama investigation . [71] Two members of FIFA's executive committee were banned from all football-related activity in November 2010 for allegedly offering to sell their votes to undercover newspaper reporters. In early May 2011, a British parliamentary inquiry into why England failed to secure the 2018 finals was told by member of parliament, Damian Collins , that there was evidence from the Sunday Times newspaper that Issa Hayatou of Cameroon and Jacques Anouma of Ivory Coast were paid by Qatar. Qatar has categorically denied the allegations, as have Hayatou and Anouma. [72] FIFA President Blatter said, as of 23 May 2011, that the British newspaper The Sunday Times has agreed to bring its whistle-blowing source to meet senior FIFA officials, who will decide whether to order a new investigation into alleged World Cup bidding corruption. ""[The Sunday Times] are happy, they agreed that they will bring this whistleblower here to Zürich and then we will have a discussion, an investigation of this"", Blatter said. Specifically, the whistleblower claims that FIFA executive committee members Issa Hayatou and Jacques Anouma were paid $1.5 million to vote for Qatar. [73] [74] The emirate's bid beat the United States in a final round of voting last December. Blatter did not rule out reopening the 2022 vote if corruption could be proved, but urged taking the matter ""step by step"". The FIFA president said his organization is ""anxiously awaiting"" more evidence before asking its ethics committee to examine allegations made in Britain's parliament in early May 2011. Hayatou, who is from Cameroon, leads the Confederation of African Football and is a FIFA vice president. Anouma is president of Ivorian Football Federation . The whistleblower said Qatar agreed to pay a third African voter, Amos Adamu , for his support. The Nigerian was later suspended from voting after a FIFA ethics court ruled he solicited bribes from undercover Sunday Times reporters posing as lobbyists. Blatter said the newspaper and its whistleblower would meet with FIFA secretary general, Jérôme Valcke , and legal director, Marco Villiger. Allegations against FIFA officials have also been made to the UK Parliament by David Triesman , the former head of England's bid and the English Football Association. Triesman told the lawmakers that four long-standing FIFA executive committee members— Jack Warner , Nicolas Leoz , Ricardo Teixeira and Worawi Makudi —engaged in ""improper and unethical"" conduct in the 2018 bidding, which was won by Russia. All six FIFA voters have denied wrongdoing. [75] On 28 September 2015, Sepp Blatter suggested that the 2018 World Cup being awarded to Russia was planned before the voting, and that the 2022 World Cup would have then been awarded to the United States. However, this plan changed after the election ballot, and the 2022 World Cup was awarded to Qatar instead of the U.S. [76] [77] 2011 FIFA presidential election [ edit ] FIFA announced on 25 May 2011 that it had opened the investigation to examine the conduct of four officials— Mohamed Bin Hammam and Jack Warner, along with Caribbean Football Union (CFU) officials Debbie Minguell and Jason Sylvester—in relation to claims made by executive committee member, Chuck Blazer . [78] [79] [80] Blazer, who is the general secretary of the CONCACAF federation, has alleged that violations were committed under the FIFA code of ethics during a meeting organized by Bin Hammam and Warner on 10 and 11 May—the same time Lord Triesman had accused Warner of demanding money for a World Cup 2018 vote—in relation to the 2011 FIFA presidential election, [81] in which Bin Hammam, who also played a key role in the Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup bid , allegedly offered financial incentives for votes cast in his favour during the presidential election. As a result of the investigation both Bin Hammam and Warner were suspended. [82] Warner reacted to his suspension by questioning Blatter's conduct and adding that FIFA secretary general, Jérôme Valcke, had told him via e-mail that Qatar had bought the 2022 World Cup. [83] [84] Valcke subsequently issued a statement denying he had suggested it was bribery, saying instead that the country had ""used its financial muscle to lobby for support"". Qatar officials denied any impropriety. [85] Bin Hammam also responded by writing to FIFA, protesting unfair treatment in suspension by the FIFA Ethics Committee and FIFA administration. [86] Further evidence emerged of alleged corruption. On 30 May 2011, Fred Lunn, vice-president of the Bahamas Football Association , said that he was given $40,000 in cash [87] as an incitement to vote for FIFA presidential candidate, Mohamed bin Hammam. In addition, on 11 June 2011 Louis Giskus, president of the Surinamese Football Association , alleged that he was given $40,000 in cash for ""development projects"" as an incentive to vote for Bin Hammam. [88] Response to allegations [ edit ] After being re-elected as President of FIFA Sepp Blatter responded to the allegations by promising to reform FIFA in wake of the bribery scandal, with Danny Jordaan , CEO of the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa, saying there is great expectation for reform. [89] Former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger is being tipped for a role on the newly proposed 'Solutions Committee', and former Netherlands national football team player Johan Cruyff is also being linked with a role. [84] [90] UEFA secretary general Gianni Infantino said he hopes for ""concrete"" measures to be taken by the world game's authority. Saying that ""the UEFA executive committee has taken note of the will of FIFA to take concrete and effective measures for good governance ... [and is] following the situation closely."" [91] IOC president Jacques Rogge commented on the situation by saying that he believes FIFA ""can emerge stronger"" from its worst ever crisis, stating that ""I will not point a finger and lecture ... I am sure FIFA can emerge stronger and from within"". [92] Several of FIFA's partners and sponsors have raised concerns about the allegations of corruption, including Coca-Cola , Adidas , Emirates and Visa . [93] [94] [95] Coca-Cola raised concerns by saying ""the current allegations being raised are distressing and bad for the sport""; with Adidas saying ""the negative tenor of the public debate around Fifa at the moment is neither good for football nor for Fifa and its partners""; moreover Emirates raised its concerns by saying ""we hope that these issues will be resolved as soon as possible""; and Visa adding ""the current situation is clearly not good for the game and we ask that Fifa take all necessary steps to resolve the concerns that have been raised."" [93] Australian Sports Minister Mark Arbib said it was clear FIFA needed to change, saying ""there is no doubt there needs to be reform of FIFA. This is something that we're hearing worldwide"", with Australian Senator Nick Xenophon accusing FIFA of ""scamming"" the country out of the A$46 million (US$35 million) it spent on the Australia 2022 FIFA World Cup bid , saying that ""until the investigation into FIFA has been completed, Australia must hold off spending any more taxpayers' money on any future World Cup bids."" [96] Theo Zwanziger , President of the German Football Association , also called on FIFA to re-examine the awarding of the 2022 FIFA World Cup to Qatar. [97] Transparency International , which had called on FIFA to postpone the election pending a full independent investigation, renewed its call on FIFA to change its governance structure. [98] Moreover, former Argentine football player Diego Maradona was critical of FIFA in light of the corruption scandal, comparing members of the board to dinosaurs. He said ""Fifa is a big museum. They are dinosaurs who do not want to relinquish power. It's always going to be the same."" [99] In October 2011, Dick Pound criticized the organization, saying, ""FIFA has fallen far short of a credible demonstration that it recognizes the many problems it faces, that it has the will to solve them, that it is willing to be transparent about what it is doing and what it finds, and that its conduct in the future will be such that the public can be confident in the governance of the sport.""
